<h1 id="TheUIdevelopmenttoolkitforHTML5">The UI development toolkit for HTML5</h1>
<p>
The toolkit for HTML5 is a JavaScript OpenAjax-compliant library for building rich internet applications. It fully supports SAP's product standards as well as RIA-like client-side features. Apart of this, it is extensible regarding custom controls, application services, theming, or custom branding. The framework is lightweight and easy to consume, so that you can combine it easily with 3rd-party JS libraries to design an HTML page and integrate it into various application frameworks or server platforms.
</p>
<h2 id="TheArtifactsintheFramework">The Artifacts in the Framework</h2>
<p>
The top-level structural unit is called a <strong><i>UI library</i></strong>. Libraries are the master artifacts in the extensibility concept. They bundle a set of controls and related types and make them consumable by web applications. There are predefined and standard libraries, like <tt>sap.ui.commons</tt> with many commonly used controls. At the same time, it treats custom UI libraries as first-class citizens, making it easy for you to write and use your own controls alongside the predefined ones.
</p>
<p>
A <strong><i>UI element</i></strong> is the basic building block of our user interfaces; it is a reusable entity with <strong><i>properties</i></strong>, <strong><i>events</i></strong>, <strong><i>methods</i></strong>, and relations. The most important relations are <strong><i>aggregations</i></strong> to other UI elements, and in this way a tree structure of elements can be created.
</p>
<p>
From a developer point of view, a <strong><i>control</i></strong> (e.g. <tt>Button</tt>, <tt>Label</tt>, <tt>TextField</tt>, or <tt>Table</tt>) is the most important artifact. It is an object which controls the appearance and user interaction of a rectangular screen region. It is a special kind of user interface element which can be used as the root of such a tree structure. In this way, it serves as an entry point, especially for rendering. Besides controls, there are also other <strong><i>non-control elements</i></strong>, which cannot be used as the root of such a tree structure, but only as a dependent part within it (e.g. <tt>TableRow</tt>, <tt>TableCell</tt>).
</p>
<p>
A <strong><i>property</i></strong> has a name and an associated data type. It has a well-defined default value expressed as a literal of that data type. Properties are accessible to application code via the element's API as getters and setters, but are also used by a control's renderer in a read-only way.
</p>
<p>
<strong><i>Data types</i></strong> are first class entities in the meta model. This allows reuse of types across libraries and extensibility of the type system. The core library (technically, this is the <tt>sap.ui.core</tt> library) already defines a core set of types that can be used in other libraries.
</p>
<p>
An <strong><i>aggregation</i></strong> is a special relation between two UI element types. It is used to define the parent/child relationship within the above mentioned tree structure. The parent end of the aggregation has cardinality 0..1, while the child end may have 0..1 or 0..*. The element's API - as generated by the tools - offers convenient and consistent methods to deal with aggregations (e.g. to get, set, or remove target elements). Examples are table rows and cells, or the content of a table cell.
</p>
<p>
An <strong><i>association</i></strong> is another type of relation between two UI element types which is independent of the parent/child relationship within the above mentioned tree structure. Directed outgoing associations to a target of cardinality 0..1 are supported. They represent a loose coupling only and are thus implemented by storing the target element instance's ID. The most prominent example is the association between a label and its field.
</p>
<p>
An <strong><i>event</i></strong> has a name as well as any number of parameters. The element's API offers support to manage event subscriptions.
</p>
<h2 id="HowtoDevelopanApplication">How to Develop an Application</h2>
<p>
As an application developer, you need to declare the list of used UI libraries when including the framework's bootstrap script. After that, you can use all controls provided by these libraries to construct one or more control trees and connect these to parts of your HTML page. You program against a well-designed control API, mostly calling setters for properties and aggregations and managing event subscriptions. The framework also supports the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to initialize controls with a reduced typing effort.  Within an event handler, you may want to retrieve control instances by ID and use getters for properties. Of course, you are free to modify a control's state from within an event handler. Rerendering will be done automatically by the framework.<br />
This way an application <a class="wiki" href="HelloWorld.html">can be created in 20 seconds</a>.
</p>
<p>
The SAPUI5 Tools for Eclipse provide wizards and support for creating SAPUI5 Applications in an easy way, which generates the necessary <a class="wiki" href="ApplicationSkel.html">Application skeleton</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="HowtoDevelopaUIControl">How to Develop a UI Control</h2>
<p>
As a control developer, you create or modify UI libraries and their pieces, i.e. controls and types. You define the set of properties your control provides as well as events or aggregations. A major task is the implementation of a control-specific renderer, which knows how to create suitable HTML markup for a given control instance, taking its current state into account. A renderer is written in JavaScript and produces HTML output which is styled by means of CSS. Such style sheets are another important part of a UI library.
