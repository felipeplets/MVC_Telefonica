<h1 id="DataBindinginCustomControls">Data Binding in Custom Controls</h1>
<p>
Most controls support data binding by default. The generic data-binding API, as provided in the Element class, allows binding of all properties and all multiple aggregations. There are some possibilities for making data binding more convenient, such as generating typed binding methods for specific properties that are most likely to be bound, and there are some use cases (such as composite controls or controls which support paging, sorting, or filtering) that involve some extra work.
</p>
<h2 id="GenericBindingMethods">Generic Binding Methods</h2>
<p>
There are two generic binding methods in the Element class, which is the base class of all controls and elements: <tt>bindProperty</tt> for binding properties to the model and <tt>bindAggregation</tt> for binding multiple aggregations.
</p>
<h3 id="PropertyBinding">Property Binding</h3>
<p>
The generic property binding works like this:
</p>
<ul><li><tt>bindProperty</tt> is called on the model instance and returns a <tt>PropertyBinding</tt> object.
</li><li><tt>attachChange</tt> is used on the <tt>PropertyBinding</tt> to get change notification for this property.
</li><li>Whenever the change event is fired, the <tt>setProperty</tt> method is called on the element.
</li></ul><h3 id="AggregationBinding">Aggregation Binding</h3>
<p>
The generic aggregation binding works like this:
</p>
<ul><li><tt>bindList</tt> is called on the model instance and returns a <tt>ListBinding</tt> object.
</li><li><tt>attachChange</tt> is used on the <tt>ListBinding</tt> to get change notification for this list.
</li><li>Whenever the change event is fired, the <tt>updateAggregation</tt> method is called.
</li><li>If a typed <tt>updateAggregation</tt> method exists, it is executed instead of the generic handling.
</li><li><tt>destroyAggregation</tt> is called to remove the current elements in the aggregation.
</li><li><tt>getBindingContexts</tt> on the <tt>ListBinding</tt> returns an array of context elements. 
</li><li>For each entry in the binding contexts, a clone of the template element is created.
</li><li><tt>setBindingContext</tt> is used to apply the binding context to each clone.
</li><li><tt>addAggregation</tt> adds the clone to the aggregation.
</li></ul><h2 id="TypedBindingMethodsforSpecificProperties">Typed Binding Methods for Specific Properties</h2>
<p>
While some properties of the controls are obvious candidates for data binding, like the value of TextFields, or the checked property of CheckBoxes, for others there will generally not be a common use case for data binding. Typed binding methods are not generated for all available properties; instead, control developers mark properties in the event that a typed binding method is required for a control.
</p>
<p>
To do this, you have to add "bindable" to the property or aggregation definition of the .control file.
</p>
<p>
Properties:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;property</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"value"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"string"</span> <span class="na">defaultValue=</span><span class="s">"''"</span> <span class="na">group=</span><span class="s">"Data"</span> <span class="na">bindable=</span><span class="s">"bindable"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>
A <tt>bindValue</tt> method is generated for this control, which can be used to bind the value property.
</p>
<p>
Aggregations:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;aggregation</span> <span class="na">cardinality=</span><span class="s">"0..n"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"rows"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"SimpleTableRow"</span> <span class="na">bindable=</span><span class="s">"bindable"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>
A <tt>bindRows</tt> method is generated for this control, which can be used to bind the rows aggregation.
</p>
<h2 id="DataBindingforCompositeControls">Data Binding for Composite Controls</h2>
<p>
For the data binding to work properly, all controls need to be part of the control hierarchy, as the model instance as well as the binding context are accessed using the parent element. Composite controls have internal controls, which can be seen from outside, but this is not the default case. Property bindings usually work without any modification, as the setters on the composite control are forwarded to the corresponding internal control, which does not need to know anything about the data binding. For aggregation bindings this is a little more complex, as each created aggregation element needs to have a different binding context and resolves existing property bindings relative to their binding context. For these to work as expected, the internal control needs to be added to an internal aggregation.
</p>
<h2 id="AdvancedAggregationBinding">Advanced Aggregation Binding</h2>
<p>
If a control has to deal with large lists of data (more than 100 entries), it is not performance-friendly to create controls for all entries.
