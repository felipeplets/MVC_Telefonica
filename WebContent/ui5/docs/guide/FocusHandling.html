<h1 id="FocusHandling">Focus Handling</h1>
<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
Each of the controls provided by the SAPUI5 framework has its own behavior for focus handling, depending on the functionality that is provided by the control. The highest level of complexity is reached in the case of complex controls and their embedded content.
</p>
<p>
For custom development of controls, the core of the framework provides mechanisms for observing the moving focus in an application page and preserves this information for refocusing elements after (re-)rendering. Furthermore, the focus triggers event firing. Due to the high degree of flexibility in control rendering, it may be necessary to implement functionality tailored to the control's inner workings. The following sections provide some insights into how to tailor this functionality.
</p>
<p>
The framework provides helper functions for implementating focus handling.
</p>
<h2 id="ImplementingFocusHandlingWhenDevelopingControls">Implementing Focus Handling When Developing Controls</h2>
<p>
The base class for all elements <tt>(Element.js)</tt> provides four methods to help you implement focus handling:
</p>
<ul><li><tt>Element.getFocusDomRef()</tt>
</li><li><tt>Element.focus()</tt>
</li><li><tt>Element.getFocusInfo()</tt>
</li><li><tt>Element.applyFocusInfo(oFocusInfo)</tt>
</li></ul><h3 id="Element.getFocusDomRef"><tt>Element.getFocusDomRef()</tt></h3>
<p>
Once a visible element is rendered, it has a Document Object Model (DOM) representation. The root DOM node can be accessed by using the method <tt>getDomRef()</tt> on the element. The root DOM node is the default focused DOM node. After rendering, the framework asks the control for its focus DOM node by using the <tt>getFocusDomRef()</tt> method. If the root DOM node does NOT represent the element that should have the focus, you have to return another DOM node by overriding the <tt>getFocusDomRef()</tt> method.
</p>
<h3 id="Element.focus"><tt>Element.focus()</tt></h3>
<p>
The <tt>focus()</tt> method sets the focus on the element. This is done using the focus DOM node.
</p>
<h3 id="Element.getFocusInfo"><tt>Element.getFocusInfo()</tt></h3>
<p>
With some controls, it is even more difficult to apply the focus once the control has been re-rendered. Controls such as lists have their own internal focus handling, which sets the focus on the different items. A <a class="missing wiki">DataTable?</a> moves the focus over a matrix of cells. The requirement is that a control can apply the focus to its exact previous position after re-rendering. To provide this functionality, you override the <tt>getFocusInfo()</tt> method, and serialize the focus state into a JSON object and return it. Before rendering, the render manager calls this method for the element instance and stores this information for future use. After rendering, it calls the method <tt>applyFocusInfo()</tt> (see next method) and passes back this serialized object. The cursor position of a TextField control, for example, can also be stored in such an object.
</p>
<h3 id="Element.applyFocusInfooFocusInfo"><tt>Element.applyFocusInfo(oFocusInfo)</tt></h3>
<p>
The <tt>applyFocusInfo()</tt> method applies the focus to the element after re-rendering. You use this method if different behavior is expected for the element. Note that the default implementation sets the focus as it is implemented in the <tt>focus()</tt> method (see above).
</p>
<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>
<p>
In our example, a control usually sets the focus on the second child node of its root node. In this case, you would simply override the <tt>getFocusDomRef()</tt> method.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">sap.ui.commons.&lt;SampleControl&gt;.getFocusDomRef = function() {
   return this.getDomRef().firstChild.nextSibling;
}
</pre><p>
Another control generally sets the focus back to the element that previously had the focus. Therefore, it overrides the methods <tt>getFocusInfo</tt> and <tt>applyFocusInfo</tt>.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">sap.ui.commons.&lt;SampleControl&gt;.getFocusInfo = function() {
   return {id:this.getId(),idx:this.&lt;myFocusElementIndex&gt;};
}
sap.ui.commons.&lt;SampleControl&gt;.applyFocusInfo = function(oFocusInfo) {
   var oDomRef = this.getDomRef();
   if (oDomRef) {
      this.&lt;myFocusElementIndex&gt; = oFocusInfo.idx;
      this.focus();
   }
}
</pre><h2 id="ConvenienceFunctionality">Convenience Functionality</h2>
<p>
In addition to the automatic focus handling provided by the interaction between the render manager and the element instance, further focus-related functionality is available in the jQuery plugin <tt>jquery.sap.dom</tt> (see <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/jQuery.sap.html#.focus" title="symbols/jQuery.sap.html#.focus in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>jQuery.sap.focus</a>) and in the <tt>sap.ui.core.Core</tt> (see <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.ui.core.Core.html#getCurrentFocusedControlId" title="symbols/sap.ui.core.Core.html#getCurrentFocusedControlId in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>Core.getCurrentFocusedControlId</a>).
