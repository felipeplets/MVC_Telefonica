<h1 id="Support-Tool">Support-Tool</h1>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="AccessingtheTool">Accessing the Tool</h2>
<p>
The Support-Tool can be opened inside an existing SAPUI5 Application using the shortcut <strong>CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + S</strong>(upport).<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="Activatingdebugsources">Activating debug sources</h2>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_001.png" />
</p>
<p>
In order to use the debugging-functionalities it is important that the debug-sources are used.<br />
The „Debug Sources“-Switch should be set to "ON". If that is not the case, it can be turned on using the "Toggle" link.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="Control-Tree">Control-Tree</h2>
<p>
The Control-Tree shows all existing controls in the application in a tree-view.
<br />
</p>
<h3 id="SelectingaControl">Selecting a Control</h3>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_002.png" />
</p>
<p>
To select a control, either the entry in the ControlTree can be clicked&hellip;
</p>
<p>
<img src="control_selection.png" />
</p>
<p>
&hellip;or a control inside of the application while holding down <strong>CTRL + SHIFT + ALT</strong> and clicking on it.
</p>
<h3 id="Changingproperties">Changing properties</h3>
<p>
<img src="changing-properties.png" />
</p>
<p>
Properties of a control can be changed in the "Properties"-Tab
<br />
</p>
<h3 id="ShowingData-BindingInformation">Showing Data-Binding Information</h3>
<p>
<img src="bindings.png" />
</p>
<p>
The "Binding Infos"-Tab shows all existing bindings for the control with some helpful information.<br />
The binding can be refreshed by clicking on the "Refresh"-Button.
</p>
<p>
<img src="binding-contexts.png" />
</p>
<p>
The binding-context for the currently selected control is also shown there.
<br />
The hyperlinks can be used to navigate to the specific controls.
</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<h3 id="AddingremovingProperty-Breakpoints">Adding / removing Property-Breakpoints</h3>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_003.png" />
</p>
<p>
The two checkboxes can be used to add or remove a breakpoint for the get/set-method of a control-property.
The lefthand checkbox handles the get-method, the righthand one the set-method.
A checked checkbox means that the breakpoint is active.
</p>
<h3 id="AddingremovingMethod-Breakpoints">Adding / removing Method-Breakpoints</h3>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_004.png" />
</p>
<p>
The auto completion can be used to find and select a method.
</p>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_005.png" />
</p>
<p>
The dropdown-box can be also used to select a method.
</p>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_006.png" />
</p>
<p>
A breakpoint for the currently selected method can be added through the "Add-Breakpoint"-button or by pressing the ENTER-key.
</p>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_007.png" />
</p>
<p>
To remove a breakpoint, the red "X" can be used. To only appears when hovering over the entry.
</p>
<h3 id="DebuggingaMethod">Debugging a Method</h3>
<p>
To start debugging, the browser's debugging-tool has to be opened and activated. If this is not the case and a breakpoint is reached a alert message will open.
</p>
<p>
Once a method with an active breakpoint gets executed, the script stops, but not directly in the method.
</p>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_008.png" />
</p>
<p>
The execution stops at the "debugger" statement. To get inside the real method, the step-over/into functionality of the debugger can be used.
</p>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_009.png" />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="Debugging-View">Debugging-View</h2>
<p>
The debugging-view allows to set breakpoints for methods on class-level.
</p>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_010.png" />
</p>
<p>
On the lefthand side a class can be selected in the same way as a method in the ControlTree.
</p>
<p>
<img src="support_tool_011.png" />
</p>
<p>
A class can be selected by clicking on it in the class-list below.<br />
To remove the class (and all active breakpoints of class-methods) the red "X" can be used. It only appears when hovering over an entry in the list.<br />
The number of active breakpoints and all methods is also shown for each class once it was selected for the first time.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
With the righthand view, breakpoints for methods of the currently selected class can be added / removed.
This works in the same way as in the ControlTree.
</p>
<h2 id="XMLViewConversion">XML View Conversion</h2>
<ul><li>We have to admit that many our code samples are written in JavaScript … while all you Fiori developers spend most of your time in an XML editor. As there is no time to convert all our code samples we now provide a generic conversion tool. 
</li><li>Follow these steps:
<ul><li>Run the desired UI5 app in your browser. E.g. open some page in the test suite.
</li><li>Press CRTL-ALT-SHIFT-S to open the support tool
</li><li>Open the “Control Tree” panel
</li><li>Select the root UI area in the left side tree
</li><li>Switch to the “Export” tab and press “Export XML”
</li><li>Open the downloaded ZIP archive and extract file(s) to the file system<br />
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
<img src="exportToXml.jpg" />         
</p>
<ul><li>Output
<ul><li>If you app does not contain a view all the stuff will be put into one view.
</li><li>If you app contains views (and they are all loaded) they will be outputed as separate files.
</li></ul></li><li>Be aware that the conversion captures the runtime state of the app which can differ from the build declaration.
</li></ul>
