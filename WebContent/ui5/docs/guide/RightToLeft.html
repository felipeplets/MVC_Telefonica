<ul><li><a class="ext-link" href="http://www.unicode.org/standard/versions/"><span class="icon"> </span>Unicode</a> defines the directionality of characters which the browser must take into account when arranging characters as words.
</li><li>The HTML "dir" attribute overrides the overall directionality of blocks (and influences the text alignment if not explicitly set). In detail there are many more effects, e.g. parentheses are mirrored and viewed as a "word" on their own, which changes their position.
</li><li>the HTML "lang" attribute does NOT influence text directionality
</li><li>document.dir can be used (browser support is there, it can be set in the bootstrap already, but webkit seems to reset this to LTR, if set too early) 
</li><li>There is a &lt;BDO&gt; HTML tag which turns off the bidirectional algorithm, i.e. the character order is not reversed if RTL and LTR words are mixed.
</li><li>CSS 2.1 has also a <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#direction"><span class="icon"> </span>"direction" property</a>
</li></ul><h3 id="Whatdoesthismeaninanutshell">What does this mean in a nutshell?</h3>
<p>
Read this to (hopefully) understand in 1-2 minutes how RTL works:
</p>
<ul><li>Each character inherently belongs to a RTL or LTR script (defined by Unicode). Some characters like parentheses and dots have no inherent directionality. Browsers know all of this.
</li><li>For single "words" (characters sequences with same directionality) the browser knows the text direction, and does it "right" automatically, handling them as sort of <strong>blocks</strong> that get their internal text direction ONLY from the used characters.
</li><li>These words/sequences/"runs" are separated by the direction-neutral characters like parentheses and dots - and obviously when character directionality changes.
</li><li>The direction in which these blocks are put <i>next to each other</i> depends on the <strong>base direction</strong>.
</li><li>The default base direction of HTML is left-to-right, but can be inverted by setting the attribute "dir='rtl'", either on the &lt;html&gt; tag or on any subregion which should have a different base direction.
</li><li>This base direction also determines the default text alignment, the order of columns in tables and the presentation of some direction-neutral characters: opening parentheses are still opening parentheses when RTL mode is switched! This means they render horizontally flipped!
</li><li>The algorithm for ordering words/runs/blocks according to the base direction only covers one level of mixed directionality. To achieve deeper nesting, spans with dir attribute can be used o define a subcontext with different base direction.
</li><li>While (as said above) words/runs internally always have the text direction implied by the used characters, this behavior can also be overridden (using the &lt;bdo&gt; tag or via CSS <tt>unicode-bidi:bidi-override</tt>) when the order of characters must follow the base direction regardless of the inherent character direction. E.g. because the characters do not form a word but are <i>really</i> just a list of characters, like e.g. in a part number.
</li><li>The "lang" attribute defining the document language does not have any influence on directionality.
</li></ul><h2 id="UI5ThemingConcept-RTLSupport">UI5 Theming Concept - RTL Support</h2>
<p>
The UI5 theming concept defines RTL support to be achieved as follows:
</p>
<ul><li>All controls are styled for the LTR case in their "normal" CSS files
<ul><li>Images are put into/below the "img" subfolder
</li></ul></li><li>The CSS generator includes an RTL flipping algorithm (inherited from previous SAP UI technologies, proven over many years, similarly also used in the Open Source community, see CSSJanus)
<ul><li><tt>border-left:</tt> is converted to <tt>border-right:</tt>, <tt>padding: 1px 2px 3px 4px;</tt> is converted to <tt>padding: 1px 4px 3px 2px;</tt>, <tt>float:left;</tt> is converted to <tt>float:right;</tt> etc. The assumption and experience is that this automated conversion does almost the whole job.
</li><li>Most CSS properties, including CSS3 ones are supported
</li></ul></li><li>CSS generation also mirrors all images inside the "img" folder, as this has been found to be the right thing in most cases
<ul><li>Some images should not be mirrored for RTL. The RTL version of those images must then be put into the "img-RTL" folder with the same location and name. In this case the image reference in the CSS is modified to point to this image.
</li></ul></li><li>A control should NOT write any special CSS classes to "notify" the CSS that RTL is turned on
<ul><li>In CSS the &lt;HTML&gt; tag's dir attribute can be checked to provide specific RTL style - but beware: the written style is still mirrored in the actual RTL case!
Example:
<pre class="wiki">html[dir=rtl] .sapUiBtn {
   color: red;
}
</pre>However: this should only be required in rare cases! If you find yourself writing this kind of style more than 1-3% of the time, you should have another look at what UI5's automatic CSS mirroring offers.
</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="ProgrammaticAccesstoRTLMode">Programmatic Access to RTL Mode</h3>
<p>
Some controls need to provide specific coding in case of RTL mode, e.g. because they are positioning or animating elements programmatically, not via CSS.
</p>
<p>
The UI5 RTL configuration can be read by calling
</p>
<pre class="wiki">var bRtl = sap.ui.getCore().getConfiguration().getRTL();
</pre><h2 id="Whatdoapplicationsneedtoknowanddo">What do applications need to know and do?</h2>
<p>
This wiki page will not supply the general knowledge to build RTL-aware applications, but with respect to UI5: the text direction is LTR by default but can be set using the various known configuration switches:
</p>
<ul><li>URL parameter <tt>sap-ui-rtl=true</tt>
</li><li>Configuration object: <tt>window["sap-ui-config"].rtl = true;</tt>
</li><li>Script tag configuration: <tt>data-sap-ui-rtl="true"</tt>
</li></ul><p>
UI5 will take care of setting the overall page direction to "RTL". All UI5 content will then be displayed in RTL mode. For self-written controls and content you need to test. If manual style adoptions are required, you need to provide style specifically for the RTL case by using <tt>html[dir=rtl]</tt> 
</p>
<h3 id="Steps">Steps</h3>
<p>
If UI5 is configured to RTL mode, the core:
</p>
<ol><li>sets dir="rtl" on the HTML tag
<ul><li>The <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/bidi-xhtml/#Slide0440"><span class="icon"> </span>W3C officially recommends</a> using the <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup"><span class="icon"> </span>HTML attribute instead of the CSS properties</a>, e.g. directionality is a matter of content, not of presentation, and because the CSS properties may even be ignored.
</li><li>Using the &lt;HTML&gt; tag (not the BODY tag) is recommended as well
</li></ul></li><li>loads the respective library-RTL.css files
