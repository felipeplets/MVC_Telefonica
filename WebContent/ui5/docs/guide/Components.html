UI5 components are independent and reusable parts of a UI5 Application. Hence, they may be developed by different development teams in different projects. An application can even use components from locations different from where this application itself is running. (Note: constraints due to cross-origin issues still apply, though.) Another advantage of componentization is not only the potential for distributed development, but also the encapsulation of closely related parts of an application into a particular component. This can help making the structure of an application and its code easier to understand and maintain.
</p>
<p>
Physically, a UI5 component is a folder whose name defines the name of the component. This folder contains all resources (like css files, internationalization files, views, images etc.) that are used within the particular component, as well as two additional files, <tt>Component.js</tt> and <tt>component.json</tt>. Note that all paths within a component are relative paths to the <tt>Component.js</tt> and not to e.g. an <tt>index.html</tt> file as could be the case in a regular web application.
</p>
<ul><li><tt>Component.js</tt> represents the component controller and provides runtime metadata.
</li><li><tt>component.json</tt> contains metadata for design time, e.g. by the App Designer.
</li></ul><p>
A component can be a <strong>faceless component</strong> or a <strong>UIComponent</strong>. Faceless components do not have any UI and could e.g. contain services providing data.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="Component">Component</h2>
<p>
<tt>Component.js</tt> contains the <tt>sap.ui.core.Component</tt> base class for faceless components as well as UI components. It provides the metadata for every component.
The <i>name</i> parameter that gets passed into the component constructor represents the package name under which your component will be found.
</p>
<h2 id="UIComponent">UI Component</h2>
<p>
If a component needs to provide any representation on the screen, a UI component should be used.
<tt>UIComponent.js</tt> extends <tt>Component.js</tt> and adds rendering functionality to the component.
</p>
<h2 id="ComponentContainer">Component Container</h2>
<p>
The <tt>ComponentContainer</tt> is a UI5 control that wraps a <tt>UIComponent</tt>. It can be injected into the UI5 control tree like any other regular control wherever it is needed.

A basic sample for the creation and usage of a UIComponent can be found here:
