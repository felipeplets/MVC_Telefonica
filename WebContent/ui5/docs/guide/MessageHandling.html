<h2 id="GuidanceonMessageContent">Guidance on Message Content</h2>
<p>
It is greatly recommended to invest care and energy in good message content:
</p>
<ul><li>Provide short and crisp error messages to the user. 
</li><li>A message should always contain a 'Call for Action'.
</li><li>To achieve the above you need to map error messages from a backend system.
</li><li>Focus on the most common error situations and improve the messages there. 
</li><li>For the rest simply state that a 'Backend' or 'Database' error has occurred. The user cannot handle this anyway and no further details are required. If technically feasible ease the process of receiving support from IT (e.g. submit issue and related information to support or at least provide contact information).
</li><li>It is a must to detect all problems related to network connectivity and indicate them as such.
</li></ul><h2 id="MessagesRelatedtoaPage">Messages Related to a Page</h2>
<p>
For showing messages to the user that are related to the currrent page you have two options depending on the importance of the message.
</p>
<h3 id="MessageDialog">Message Dialog</h3>
<ul><li>A message dialog interrupts the user's workflow by blocking the current page and needs to be closed by the user.
</li><li>Use a message dialog if the message is important and must be acknowledged by the user.
</li><li>The easiest way of showing a message dialog is to use the <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.MessageBox.html" title="symbols/sap.m.MessageBox.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.m.MessageBox</a> API.
</li><li>If you want full control of the content you can also use <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.Dialog.html" title="symbols/sap.m.Dialog.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.m.Dialog</a> control and set the <tt>type</tt> to <tt>sap.m.DialogType.Message</tt>. 
</li></ul><h3 id="MessageToast">Message Toast</h3>
<ul><li>A message toast is an overlay that disappears after some time or if the user taps somewhere else. It does not block the user. 
</li><li>Use this pattern if the message is less important and the user should not be blocked in his work.
</li><li>You can open an message toast easily with the <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.MessageToast.html" title="symbols/sap.m.MessageToast.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.m.MessageToast</a> API.
</li></ul><h2 id="MessagesRelatedtoElementsofaPage">Messages Related to Elements of a Page</h2>
<p>
For showing messages to the user that are related to a specific element of a page there is no dedicated UI control available in <tt>sap.m</tt> in this version. Recommended approach is to use an <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.ui.core.HTML.html" title="symbols/sap.ui.core.HTML.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.ui.core.HTML</a> control to show these error messages 'somewhere close to the input' or use some kind of overlay. Consider that the user will have the on screen keyboard open which might hide messages. Putting the message above an input field could help.
</p>
<p>
You can set the <tt>ValueState</tt> of the <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.Input.html" title="symbols/sap.m.Input.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.m.Input</a> control to <tt>Error</tt> to indicate that the content  is not correct. 
</p>
<h2 id="MultipleMessages">Multiple Messages</h2>
<p>
In SAPUI5 Mobile there are today no means to show multiple messages at the same time like the <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.ui.commons.MessageBar.html" title="symbols/sap.ui.commons.MessageBar.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.ui.commons.MessageBar</a> for SAPUI5 Desktop. Mobile Designs recommend to be 'more sparse' with messages, i.e. only show one message at a time. This can also be achieved by combining and reducing multiple messages.
