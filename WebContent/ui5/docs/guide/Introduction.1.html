<h2 id="Definition">Definition</h2>
<p>
Data binding is a technique that binds two data/information sources together in order to keep them in sync. When data binding is properly implemented and defined, all changes in one data source are automatically reflected in the other. In the UI, data binding is usually used to bind the UI controls to a data source that holds the application data, so that the controls are updated automatically whenever the application data is changed.
</p>
<p>
The term "data binding" is also used when changes in the control, such as data being entered by a user, cause updates in the underlying application data. This is called bidirectional or two-way binding.
</p>
<h2 id="Purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>
The purpose of data binding in the UI is to separate the definition of the user interface (view), the data that is going to be visualized by the application (model), and the code for the business logic that is processing the data (controller). This is widely known as the MVC (model, view, controller) paradigm. There are several positive aspects of this separation of concerns: In addition to better readability, maintainability, and extensibility, it allows you to change the view without touching the underlying business logic and to define several views of the same data.

<h2 id="Design">Design</h2>
<p>
While there are many possible data sources in a Web application (JSON, XML, Atom, or OData) that should be suppported, the way in which the binding is defined and the implementation of data binding within the UI controls should be independent of the specific data source. In addition, it should be possible to create a custom model implementation for data sources that are not yet covered by the framework or are domain-specific.
</p>
<p>
To achieve this, there is a <tt>Model</tt> and a <tt>Binding</tt>. The <tt>Model</tt> instance holds the data and provides methods to set the data or to retrieve data from a server. It also provides a method for creating bindings to the data. When this method is called, a <tt>Binding</tt> instance is created, which contains the binding information and provides an event, which is fired whenever the bound data is changed. An Element can listen to this event and update its visualization according to the new data.
