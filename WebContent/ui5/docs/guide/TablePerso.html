<h1 id="TablePersonalizationConcept">Table Personalization Concept</h1>
<p>
The simple concept of table personalization is to be able to allow the user to personalize a table and have those personalizations persist. The specific table personalizations that are currently supported relate to columns: which columns are visible, and in what order they are presented.
</p>
<p>
The idea is that you can invoke table personalization with minimum effort. 
</p>
<h2 id="Components">Components</h2>
<p>
The table personalization concept is built upon three distinct artifacts:
</p>
<ul><li>a table personalization dialog sap.m.TablePersoDialog
</li><li>a table personalization controller sap.m.TablePersoController
</li><li>a table personalization persistence service provider, based on abstract class sap.m.TablePersoProvider
</li></ul><h3 id="TablePersonalizationDialog">Table Personalization Dialog</h3>
<p>
The table personalization dialog sap.m.TablePersoDialog is a visual control that can be invoked independently or within the context of the table personalization controller. On instantiation, you specify for which table object the personalization dialog is to be used. The dialog can then be displayed by calling the open() method. The dialog shows the list of columns in the table, in the order that they appear, and whether their visibility is set on or off. The dialog can then be used by the user to adjust these details. 
</p>
<p>
When the dialog is closed, a close event is fired which you can react to, and there is a retrievePersonalizations method that can be used to retrieve the details of the column order and visibility setings made.
</p>
<p>
The personalization settings retrieved with the retrievePersonalizations method is an object with currently a single property aColumns, the value of which is an array of column objects each with the following properties:
</p>
<ul><li>id (string): the SAPUI5 id of the column
</li><li>order (integer): the order of the column (0 is first, etc)
</li><li>text (string): the text of the column header
</li><li>visible (boolean): whether the column is visible (true) or not (false) 
</li></ul><p>
Note that this TablePersoDialog control does not adjust the table itself. This is realised by the use of a table personalization controller (see below). 
</p>
<p>
You would use this table personalization dialog on its own only if you wanted to present a personalization dialog and nothing more (e.g. you intended to manage the persistence of the personalized settings yourself).
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of how you would use a table personalization dialog:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="c1">// Create the table, with a button to invoke the personalization dialog
</span>var oTable <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> sap<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">m</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Table</span><span class="o">({</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="nl">headerToolbar:</span> <span class="o">({</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
            <span class="k">new</span> sap<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">m</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Button</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"idPersonalizeButton"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="nl">text:</span> <span class="s">"Personalize"</span> <span class="o">})</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="o">}),</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="o">});</span>

<span class="c1">// Instantiate a table personalization dialog for the table
</span>oTablePersoDialog <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> sap<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">m</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">TablePersoDialog</span><span class="o">({</span>
    <span class="nl">persoDialogFor:</span> oTable
<span class="o">});</span>

<span class="c1">// Cause the dialog to open when the button is pressed

    oTablePersoDialog<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">open</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">});</span>

<span class="c1">// Catch the dialog close event and do something with the personalizations made
</span>oTablePersoDialog<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">attachClose</span><span class="o">(</span>function<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    var oPersoData <span class="o">=</span> oTablePersoDialog<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">retrievePersonalizations</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="c1">// do something with oPersoData
</span><span class="o">});</span>
</pre></div><h3 id="TablePersonalizationController">Table Personalization Controller</h3>
<p>
The table personalization controller sap.m.TablePersoController can be seen as a wrapper around three things:
</p>
<ul><li>your table (to be personalized)
</li><li>a table personalization dialog
</li><li>a table personalization persistence service provider
</li></ul><p>
As an application developer you would probably want to use a table personalization controller. The controller manages the instantiation of the table personalization dialog, and the connection to the table persistence service provider (see later). It also applies the personalizations to the table once the dialog is closed with the "OK" button.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of how a table personalization controller can be used, assuming the table was created in the same way as the previous example, and assuming you are running in the context of the unified shell, which provides backend services such as persistence.
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="c1">// Create a persistence key
</span>var oPersId <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="nl">container:</span> <span class="s">"mycontainer-1"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nl">item:</span> <span class="s">"myitem-1"</span><span class="o">};</span>

<span class="c1">// Get a personalization service provider from the shell (or create your own)
</span>var oProvider <span class="o">=</span> sap<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ushell</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Container</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getService</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Personalization"</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">getPersonalizer</span><span class="o">(</span>oPersId<span class="o">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Instantiate a controller connecting your table and the persistence service
</span>var oTablePersoController <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> sap<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">m</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">TablePersoController</span><span class="o">({</span>
    <span class="nl">table:</span> oTable<span class="o">,</span>
    <span class="nl">persoService:</span> oProvider
<span class="o">}).</span><span class="na">activate</span><span class="o">();</span>

<span class="c1">// Cause the dialog to open when the button is pressed
</span>sap<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ui</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getCore</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">byId</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"idPersonalization"</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">attachPress</span><span class="o">(</span>function<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    oTablePersoController<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">openDialog</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</pre></div><p>
This is similar to the use of the standalone table personalization dialog, except that once the dialog is closed, the personalizations made are applied to the table automatically, and persisted. Conversely, when the controller is instantiated, any existing personalizations are fetched and applied to the table. The link to the persistence service provider, the instantiation of a table personalization dialog object, and the automatic appliance of any personalization settings to the table is invoked with the activate method as shown above.
</p>
<p>
As well as the openDialog and activate methods shown, there are also methods to apply and save the personalizations: applyPersonalizations and savePersonalizations respectively.
</p>
<p>
Note the reference to "create your own" in the above code example. The unified shell will provide a shell-based personalization persistence service provider (see below), but you are of course free to build your own. One simple example might be the use of browser local storage to read and write data.
</p>
<h3 id="TablePersonalizationPersistenceServiceProvider">Table Personalization Persistence Service Provider</h3>
<p>
The table personalization persistence service provider should be based on the abstract class sap.m.TablePersoProvider. Do not instantiate and use this sap.m.TablePersoProvider class directly as a provider; it merely describes the interface that a real persistence service provider should be built to.
</p>
<p>
The interface is simple:
</p>
<ul><li>on instantiation, persistence identification can be supplied; this will be used as the key for retrieving, saving and removing the personalization data
</li><li>there are three methods
<ul><li>getPersData(): retrieve the personalizations
</li><li>setPersData(oPersonalizationData): save the given personalization data
</li><li>delPersData(): remove the personalization data 
</li></ul></li></ul><p>
Note that there are no keys specified in the calls to the get, set and del functions. These should be inherent from the original instantiation of the service and used implicitly. In future there may be a requirement to supply a variant style sub-key, but this is not yet implemented.
</p>
<h4 id="ShellTablePersonalizationPersistenceServiceProvider">Shell Table Personalization Persistence Service Provider</h4>
<p>
A concrete implementation of the Table Personalization Persistence Service Provider (sap.m.TablePersoProvider) is available from the Unified Shell services. <strong>Please note that this is not part of the SAPUI5 framework, is delivered separately, and you must check that this service is available in your application context.</strong> The previous code example shows this persistence service provider being instantiated and utilized in the controller.
</p>
<h2 id="FAQs">FAQs</h2>
<h3 id="Wheredothecolumnheadertextscomefrom">Where do the column header texts come from?</h3>
<p>
The column header texts come directly from the table that is associated with the controller. They are read from the table when the dialog is opened. They currently do not use any translations from the backend.
 
</p>
<h3 id="CanIspecifythecolumnsthatarevisiblebydefault">Can I specify the columns that are visible by default?</h3>
<p>
You should do this in the table definition, rather than the dialog or controller, which are currently designed to take whatever the current settings for the table are at the time of invocation.
