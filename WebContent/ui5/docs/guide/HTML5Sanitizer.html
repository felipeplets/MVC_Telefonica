<h1 id="HTML5Sanitizer">HTML5 Sanitizer</h1>
<p>
The HTML5 Sanitizer can be used to cleanup HTML5 code snippets by removing potentially executable javascript. For this approach the HTML4 Sanitizer by Google is reused and adapted for the usage of HTML5 coding. The Google Santizer also supports CSS3 coding. In addition the final Sanitizer makes use of the <a class="wiki" href="URLWhiteList.html">URL Whitelist Service</a> which checks embedded URLs for correct formatting or against a given whitelist. For adapting the Sanitizer to support HTML5 the HTML Attributes and Elements were reorganized according to the actual HTML5 specification from the W3C. All types and flags were reviewed again as accurately as possible with HTML4 only elements removed, you can still see them as comments. All rules which are new or changed from the old HTML4 file are also marked "new" within the comment. The comments also state which attributes and elements are assigned to respective types and flags. All rules which were not 100% clear were analyzed in a way of similarity, so for example "audio" and "video" content behaves like images etc. URIEFFECTS state if a URL is loaded inplace within a tag where the actual document is in control of what type of content is loaded like "image" or if a new document is loaded like with "a href". LOADERTYPES state if content is loaded as sandboxed which means it is loaded within a specific surrounding player like with video content for example or if it is loaded freely without restrictions. Internally controls which accept arbitrary HTML content like the <tt>sap.ui.richttexteditor.RichTextEditor</tt> or the <tt>sap.ui.core.HTML</tt> use the HTML5 Sanitizer to sanitize the HTML code of their content and value to not infiltrate any dangerous coding. The option to sanitize the value can be enabled or disabled in the respective control properly via property: <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.ui.richtexteditor.RichTextEditor.html#setSanitizeValue" title="symbols/sap.ui.richtexteditor.RichTextEditor.html#setSanitizeValue in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>RichTextEditor.sanitizeValue</a> or <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.ui.core.HTML.html#setSanitizeContent" title="symbols/sap.ui.core.HTML.html#setSanitizeContent in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>HTML.sanitizeContent</a>. For the HTML control it is disabled by default whereas for the RichTextEditor the sanitize option is enabled.
