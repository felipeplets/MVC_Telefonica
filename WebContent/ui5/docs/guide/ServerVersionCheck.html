<h2 id="Whatisthisfor">What is this for?</h2>
<p>
When you are developing SAPUI5 applications with the SAPUI5 Tools the code completion and application preview features are based on the SAPUI5 runtime libraries, which has been installed in your Eclipse installation. However after you have deployed the application to the ABAP server and execute it there, it will use the SAPUI5 runtime libraries, which have been installed on the ABAP server.<br />
It is recommended to always have the same library version installed in Eclipse as well as on the ABAP server. If this is not the case (e.g. if the local version is higher than the one on the server) the following could happen:
</p>
<ul><li>During development you could use features which are not available on the server, yet.
</li><li>When <a class="wiki" href="TestingInEclipse.html">testing in Eclipse</a> the application might behave differently, e.g. because in the newer runtime version some issues have been fixed, which still occur on the server.
</li></ul><p>
Please check the <a class="wiki" href="CompatibilityRules.html">compatibility rules</a> which apply for the SAPUI5 runtime libraries.
</p>
<h2 id="HowcanIknow">How can I know</h2>
<p>
When you share a SAPUI5 Application project with the SAPUI5 ABAP Repository or start the submit wizard, a version comparison of the local libraries against the server will be performed.
In case they are different, a warning popup will be shown which tells you the current versions. In case you want to continue with that, the popup can be suppressed for that project and this version constellation.
</p>
<h2 id="WhatcanIdo">What can I do</h2>
<p>
To prevent the above problems from occurring, when using different runtime library versions locally and on the server, the following measures are recommended:
</p>
<ul><li>Check the JavaScript Documentation of used controls and their methods for <strong>@since</strong> tags. They indicate which version has introduced a new feature which you are going to use. 
</li><li>When <a class="wiki" href="TestingInEclipse.html">testing in Eclipse</a> you should configure it to use the runtime libraries located on the server instead of the local ones as described <a class="wiki" href="TestingInEclipse.html#UI5LibraryLocationUsedforTesting">here</a>.
</li><li>Always test your application on the server after submitting changes.
</li></ul>
