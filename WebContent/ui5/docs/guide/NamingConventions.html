<h1 id="NamingConventionsforControlandApplicationDevelopment">Naming Conventions for Control and Application Development</h1>
<h2 id="ControlAPI">Control API</h2>
<p>
We recommend to use following naming conventions for control artifacts:  
</p>
<ul><li>A control name should start with an upper case letter and use <a class="ext-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase/"><span class="icon"> </span>camel case</a> for concatenated words (example: <i>MatrixLayout</i>). 
</li><li>A control property name should start with a lower case letter and use camel case to for concatenated words (example: <i>colSpan</i>). 
</li><li>An control event name should start with a lower case letter and use camel case to for concatenated words (example: <i>press</i>).  
</li><li>A control method should start with a lower case letter and use camel case to for concatenated words (example: <i>doSomething</i>). 
</li><li>A control aggregation should start with a lower case letter and use camel case to for concatenated words.  
</li><li>A control association should start with a lower case letter use camel case to for concatenated words. 
</li><li>For a control, properties, events and relations should have unique names to avoid name clashes for generated classes. 
</li><li>Parameters of control events should start with a lower case letter. 
</li></ul><p>
The SAPUI5 tools will check and enforce some of these rules.  
</p>
<p>
For control development, the generated setter/getter-methods for the properties, as well as the generated methods for the events (<i>attach&lt;EventName&gt;</i>), for the aggregations and associations will use camel case notation. 
</p>
<p>
SAPUI5 controls have constructors which accept a set of properties and events as JSON string. The framework expects that the names used as keys in a JSON string exactly match the case of the defined control properties and events. 
</p>
<p>
If SAPUI5 controls are exposed as tags, the tag name and its attributes should fit to following convention:
</p>
<ul><li>Tag names should start with a lower case letter, and camel case should be used for concatenated words. Tag names should match the names of the control except tag names start in lower case. This establishes a natural relation between the tag and its control (example: <i>matrixLayout</i>). 
</li><li>Tag attributes should start with lower case letters, and camel case should be used for concatenated words (example: <i>colSpan</i>).
</li><li>Tag attributes for event handlers should be named <i>on&lt;event-name&gt;</i>, all in lower case letters (example: <i>onpress</i>). 
</li></ul><h2 id="HTMLDOMrelatedRenderersApplicationDevelopment">HTML/DOM related (Renderers, Application Development)</h2>
<h3 id="ReservedCharactersforControlIDs">Reserved Characters for Control IDs</h3>
<p>
The SAPUI5 framework regards the dash '-' as a forbidden character for control IDs. Applications must not use this character in their control IDs. 
</p>
<p>
Control Renderers however can and should use the dash to derive synthetic IDs from control Ids (e.g. by appending a suffix like "-mysuffix"
to the control ID). By reserving the '-', naming conflicts with the application can be avoided.
</p>
<table class="wiki">
<tr><td>Character</td><td>Description
</td></tr><tr><td><strong>-</strong></td><td>The minus is reserved as a separator for synthetic IDs
</td></tr></table>
<h3 id="ReservedIDsforDOMnodeselements">Reserved IDs for DOM nodes/elements</h3>
<p>
The following table contains a list with reserved IDs by SAPUI5 Core:
</p>
<table class="wiki">
<tr><td>ID</td><td>Description
</td></tr><tr><td><tt>sap-ui-bootstrap</tt></td><td>ID of the bootstrap script tag
</td></tr><tr><td><tt>sap.ui.core-script</tt></td><td>ID of the bootstrap script tag</td><td><i>deprecated</i>

</td></tr><tr><td><tt>*-r</tt></td><td>Suffix for former UR LightSpeed root areas (similar to <tt>UIArea</tt> of SAPUI5)

<p>
Within the <tt>sap-ui-</tt> namespace the following IDs are currently used:

The following table contains a list of reserved DOM element attributes names:
</p>
<table class="wiki">
<tr><td>Attribute</td><td>Description

<p>
In general all custom attibutes should be prefixed with <tt>data-</tt>.

<h3 id="ReservedURLParameters">Reserved URL Parameters</h3>
<p>
The following table contains a list of reserved URL parameter names that should be avoided 
by applications (Applications can use these SAPUI5 parameters. However, they should not use these to name their
own parameters):

<h2 id="ControlCSS">Control CSS</h2>
<ul><li>To avoid collisions, all CSS classes written to the HTML must start with "sap" if developed inside SAP, and with "sapUi" or "sapM" if developed inside the UI5 development teams. Outside the respective groups this prefixes should not be used.
</li><li>CSS classes for a certain control should add the control name or an abbreviation of it to the above prefix. Controls outside the "commons" library may benefit from adding also the library name in between, especially if developed outside the core UI5 development teams. 
<ul><li>The HTML root element of every control should have this CSS class name written, any inner HTML elements requiring a class name should use this class name and add a suffix.
</li></ul></li><li>All CSS selectors written by UI5 control developers must refer to at least one such CSS class, pure HTML elements should not be styled (to avoid affecting non-owned HTML)
</li><li>Inline CSS should only be used for control instance specific style (like the button width)
</li></ul><h3 id="StylingContexts">Styling Contexts</h3>
<p>
When the visuals of certain controls are different depending on the context/container where they are used, the suggested pattern to achieve this is using CSS cascades: 
</p>
<ul><li>The area/container shall write a certain marker CSS class to the HTML and document this CSS class in its JSDoc. The documentation should mention the purpose and contract/meaning of this class, e.g. that it is meant to modify the appearance of children in a way that better fits table cells, toolbars or headers.
</li><li>This CSS class may not have any CSS styles attached, it is a pure marker (such styles would also need to stay stable and might cause trouble for other containers where these styles are not desired)
</li><li>The naming convention for these classes is to have the suffix "-CTX", e.g.  "sapUiTable-CTX" or "sapMList-CTX" or "sapUiBorderless-CTX". This makes them easily discernible from "normal" CSS class names.
</li><li>Controls which want to modify their appearance in such an area shall have CSS where this marker class is used in a cascade and provides the suitable style (e.g.  .sapUiTable-CTX .myCompanyInputField { border: none; })
</li></ul>
