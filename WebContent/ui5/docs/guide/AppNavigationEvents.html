<h1 id="NavigationandLifecycleEventsintheAppandtheNavContainer">Navigation and Lifecycle Events in the App and the NavContainer</h1>
<p>
Many mobile apps are composed of some pages and the user can drill-down to detail pages and go back up again (visualized often by horizontal slide animations).<br />
UI5 supports this Pattern by providing the <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.App.html" title="symbols/sap.m.App.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.m.App</a> control which can handle pages and navigation between them.<br />
Internally sap.m.App inherits the navigation capabilities from the <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.NavContainer.html" title="symbols/sap.m.NavContainer.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.m.NavContainer</a> control, so with regards to navigation and navigation events both are equal and this documentation will only talk about the NavContainer - but everything also applies to the sap.m.App control.
</p>
<p>
While a mobile application could centrally control this navigation flow and directly trigger the initialization or refresh of the pages, it is also beneficial when this can be done non-centrally, e.g. to support better modularization of the application: the code that constructs a page should also be the code that handles e.g. loading data in this page.
</p>
<p>
To support this, SAPUI5 provides two types of events:
</p>
<ul><li>Events fired by the App/NavContainer whenever it navigates
</li><li>Events fired ON the pages when they get shown or hidden by navigation
</li></ul><h2 id="EventsfiredcentrallybytheAppNavContainer">Events fired centrally by the App/NavContainer</h2>
<p>
Whenever navigation occurs, triggered by calling NavContainer.to(&hellip;) or NavContainer.back(&hellip;), the NavContainer triggers events to which an application can register. One event ("navigate") is fired before the transition animation starts and the other ("afterNavigate") once the animation has completed.<br />
These events contain plenty of information about the page which is being left and the page which is the target of navigation and what kind of navigation is happening.
</p>
<p>
Usage example:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>app<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">attachNavigate</span><span class="o">(</span>function<span class="o">(</span>evt<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
   var isBack <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">!</span>evt<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getParameter</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"isTo"</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// there are several types of back animation, but we want the general direction only
</span>   alert<span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Navigating "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">(</span>isBack <span class="o">?</span> <span class="s">"back "</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="s">""</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">" to page "</span> <span class="o">+</span> evt<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getParameter</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"toId"</span><span class="o">));</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</pre></div><p>
Check out the official documentation of <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.NavContainer.html#event:navigate" title="symbols/sap.m.NavContainer.html#event:navigate in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>navigate</a> and <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.NavContainer.html#event:afterNavigate" title="symbols/sap.m.NavContainer.html#event:afterNavigate in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>afterNavigate</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="EventsfiredonthePages">Events fired on the Pages</h2>
<p>
This is what allows decentral reaction to navigation. The NavContainer also fires events on its child controls when they are being displayed or hidden.
</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> while this documentation calls them pages and a sap.m.Page control may be the typical child of a NavContainer, any "full-screen" control can be used: e.g. a sap.m.Carousel control or a custom control. Therefore the Event cannot be fired BY the child control, but it is rather fired by the NavContainer ON the child control (whatever type it is). Hence the slightly different registration compatred to normal control events.
</p>
<p>
Before the navigation animation starts, the NavContainer fires the following events:
</p>
<ul><li>"beforeHide" (on the page which is about to be left)
</li><li>"beforeFirstShow" (on the page which is about to be shown - but only if it has never be shown before)
</li><li>"beforeShow" (on the page which is about to be shown)
</li></ul><p>
This event can be used to create or update the UI of the new page and to stop any activity (like animations or repeated data polling) on the page which is left.
</p>
<p>
After navigation has completed and the new page has covered the whole sccreen, the following events are fired:
</p>
<ul><li>"afterShow" (on the page which is now shown)
</li><li>"afterHide" (on the page which has been left) 
</li></ul><p>
The hidden page can be destroyed if desired and the now active page could start certain activity.
</p>
<p>
You can register to these events using the "addEventDelegate" function available on every Control.
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>page1<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addEventDelegate</span><span class="o">({</span>
   <span class="nl">onBeforeShow:</span> function<span class="o">(</span>evt<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// page1 is about to be shown; act accordingly - if required you can read event information from the evt object
</span>   <span class="o">},</span>
   <span class="nl">onAfterHide:</span> function<span class="o">(</span>evt<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="c1">// ...
</span>   <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</pre></div><p>
You can find the complete documentation <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.NavContainerChild.html" title="symbols/sap.m.NavContainerChild.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="PassingDatawhenNavigating">Passing Data when Navigating</h2>
<p>
When using the "to(&hellip;)" and "back(&hellip;)" methods of the NavContainer to trigger navigation, an optional payload data object can also be given. This object is then available in the "beforeShow", "afterShow" etc. events described above. This mechanism can also be used to decouple page implementations.
</p>
<p>
Example:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>app<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">to</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"detailPage"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="nl">id:</span><span class="s">"42"</span><span class="o">});</span> <span class="c1">// trigger navigation and hand over a data object
</span>                                 <span class="c1">// this data object could also be a binding context when dealing with data binding
</span><span class="o">...</span>

<span class="c1">// and where the detail page is implemented:
</span>myDetailPage<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addEventDelegate</span><span class="o">({</span>
   <span class="nl">onBeforeShow:</span> function<span class="o">(</span>evt<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      var idToRetrieve <span class="o">=</span> evt<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">;</span>
      <span class="c1">// ...now retrieve the data element with the given ID and update the page UI
</span>   <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">});</span>
</pre></div><p>
When a page is navigated back to, it receives the original data object which has been given when the page was first navigted to, but you can also give an additional data object with the back navigation. Again, you can find the complete documentation in the <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.NavContainer.html" title="symbols/sap.m.NavContainer.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>NavContainer</a> for firing the event and <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.NavContainerChild.html" title="symbols/sap.m.NavContainerChild.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>here</a> for receiving the data.

The Model-View-Controller example application illustrates the usage of these navigation events and how they help in modularizing an application. You can launch it from <a class="missing wiki">this page?</a>.
