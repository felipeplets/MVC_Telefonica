<p>
One common pattern for keyboard navigation is the item navigation in lists. SAPUI5 therefore provides a helper class <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.ui.core.delegate.ItemNavigation.html" title="symbols/sap.ui.core.delegate.ItemNavigation.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.ui.core.delegate.ItemNavigation</a> that implements this functionality. It is intended to be used as a <strong>delegate</strong> for the keyboard events occurring inside the using control.
</p>
<p>
Each control that needs the ability to navigate with arrow keys over a one dimensional list of DOM nodes can use this delegate.
The delegate hooks into the browser events for arrow up/down/left/right, page up/down and home/end keys. With a list of DOM nodes provided by the 
control it sets the focus to the right DOM node in the list while handling the events.
</p>
<p>
In order to use this item navigation handling, the control needs to provide a DOM node that surrounds all DOM nodes of the items as well as a list of all the DOM nodes of the items themselves. The surrounding DOM node should initially get the focus when the control is entered to ensure the ItemNavigation delegate can do proper focus handling.
</p>
<p>
Via the methods <tt>setCycling</tt> the developer can choose whether the focus automatically moves to the top after the end of the list was reached. 
The page up/down keys will only work if the control developer sets a page size via <tt>setPageSize</tt> method on the delegate.
</p>
<p>
Some controls also have one currently selected item in the list that initially should get the focus when the Control is entered (again). With the <tt>setSelectedIndex</tt> method the control can specify such a preselected item for the delegate. If no selected index is given the first item will
get the focus when entering the control.
</p>
<p>
If the control needs to be triggered before it will be focused by the item navigation, it can handle the events <tt>BeforeFocus</tt> respectively <tt>AfterFocus</tt>, to do e.g. preparation tasks for the controls visibility etc. 
</p>
<p>
Using this delegate will save your control about 100 lines of JavaScript code for keyboard handling. 
If you like you can still react on the events handled by the delegate in your control.

<p>
A delegate should be applied in the <tt>onAfterRendering</tt> hook of a control and besides that should be applied only once:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">sap.ui.commons.ListBox.prototype.onAfterRendering = function () {
        //Collect the dom references of the items 
	var oFocusRef = this.getDomRef(),
		aRows = oFocusRef.getElementsByTagName("TR"),
		aDomRefs = [];
	for (var i=0;i&lt;aRows.length;i++) {
		aDomRefs.push(aRows[i].firstChild);
	}
        //initialize the delegate add apply it to the control (only once)
	if (!this.oItemNavigation) {
		this.oItemNavigation = new sap.ui.core.delegate.ItemNavigation();
		this.addDelegate(this.oItemNavigation);
	}

        // After each rendering the delegate needs to be initialized as well.

        //set the root dom node that surrounds the items
	this.oItemNavigation.setRootDomRef(oFocusRef);

        //set the array of dom nodes representing the items.
	this.oItemNavigation.setItemDomRefs(aDomRefs);

	//turn of the cycling
        this.oItemNavigation.setCycling(false);

        //set the selected index
	this.oItemNavigation.setSelectedIndex(this.getSelectedIndex());
	
        //set the page size
	this.oItemNavigation.setPageSize(this.getVisibleItems());
};
</pre><p>
Please ensure that the delegate is also correctly removed after the control is destroyed. Otherwise memory will leak because DOM nodes are still referenced by the delegate.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">sap.ui.commons.ListBox.prototype.destroy = function() {
	if (this.oItemNavigation) {
		this.removeDelegate(this.oItemNavigation);
		this.oItemNavigation.destroy();
	}
};
