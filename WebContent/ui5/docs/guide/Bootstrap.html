<p>
To make use of the SAPUI5 framework or its controls, applications must include SAPUI5 into their HTML pages. 
</p>
<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
There is a broad range of alternatives, how the SAPUI5 runtime and controls can be integrated into an HTML page. Common to all alternatives is the need to load and execute at least one UI5 specific JavaScript resource. The following table lists the most important resources and describes the use case that they are intended for. The names of the resources are meant relative to the <tt>resources/</tt>folder of an UI5 installation. The concrete base URL depends on the platform and administrator decisions.
</p>
<table class="wiki">
<tr><td><strong>Resource</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong>
</td></tr><tr><td>sap-ui-core.js</td><td><strong>standard bootstrap file</strong> that already contains jQuery, jquery-ui-position and a minimal UI5 core. Required files are loaded dynamically using XMLHttpRequests (XHRs)
</td></tr><tr><td>sap-ui-core-nojQuery.js</td><td>intended for applications that bring their own jQuery version with them. It contains the same parts of UI5, but <strong>anything from jQuery is left out</strong> (jQuery &amp; jquery-ui-position)
</td></tr><tr><td>sap-ui-core-all.js</td><td><strong>single js file containing (nearly) all resources from the sap.ui.core library</strong>. Only a few duplicates (multiple jQuery versions), testing stuff etc. are omitted. When this file is used, for all other libraries the *-all.js file is loaded as well. This reduces the number of JS request to the number of libraries (typically 1..4). Note: for proper encapsulation reasons, the *-all.js files will be renamed in future versions of SAPUI5. The sap-ui-core-all.js will remain as is, but for other libraries the file will use a name relative to the libary, e.g. <tt>sap/ui/commons/library-all.js</tt>. <br /> <strong>Applications never should address these files on their own, but let the UI5 runtime load them</strong>. Only sap-ui-core-all.js might be referenced in the bootstrap tag.
</td></tr><tr><td>sap/ui/core/library-preload.js</td><td>similar to the *-all.js file but modules are not parsed and executed immmediately, only on demand. <strong>Applications never must reference this file themselves, it is automatically loaded by UI5</strong> when the configuration option 'preload' is given.
</td></tr><tr><td>sap-ui-core-lean.js</td><td>same outcome and mechanisms as with sap-ui-core.js, but only jQuery and one UI5 file are immediately loaded, the rest is loaded dynamically. Usually not used by most applications, might be removed in the future.
</td></tr><tr><td>sap-ui5.js</td><td>all-in-one file that contains all JS modules from the sap.ui.core, sap.ui.commons, sap.ui.table and sap.ui.ux3 libraries. Using this file as bootstrap file might require a longer load time as the other techniques but requires a single request only. Another drawback is the fixed set of libraries. <br /> This file is not available on all platforms, only on those based on the <tt>sapui5.war / sapui5-static.zip</tt> artifacts. E.g. the OSGI/Eclipse versions (<tt>com.sap.ui5.core.jar</tt>) don't contain it.
</td></tr><tr><td>sap-ui-custom*.js</td><td>names reserved for custom merged files created by the application. Note: the proposed naming scheme for these files needs to be adapted in future versions for the same encapsulation reasons as mentioned above.
</td></tr></table>

<h3 id="StandardVariant">Standard Variant</h3>
<p>
The most common variant to load SAPUI5 is to include the sap-ui-core.js file. It is self contained in the sense that it already brings jQuery and some jQuery plugins with it. Applications only need to specify this single resource in their page, the rest is done automatically by the UI5 runtime. 
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    <span class="o">&lt;</span>script 
            id<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sap-ui-bootstrap"</span>            
            src<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"resources/sap-ui-core.js"</span> 
            data<span class="o">-</span>sap<span class="o">-</span>ui<span class="o">-</span>libs<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sap.ui.commons"</span>
            data<span class="o">-</span>sap<span class="o">-</span>ui<span class="o">-</span>theme<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sap_goldreflection"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;/</span>script<span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>
If UI libraries are specified, UI5 loads them all synchronously (see below for an explanation what loading a library means). If a libary requires another libary that has not been mentioned in the configuration, then that required library is automatically loaded as well. The theme configuration is used to load the corresponding stylesheets for all libraries.
</p>
<p>
Immediately after the above script tag, applications can call most of the UI5 APIs. Especially, they can access the Core APIs or instantiate, configure and place controls. Only access to the DOM must be delayed until the controls have been rendered. This happens at the earliest immediately after the document became ready. Applications can use the attachInitEvent method to be notified about that point in time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> As a further optimization to the standard variant, UI5 in its default configuration automatically activates the <tt>preload=sync</tt> mode (explained below) when running from  optimized sources.
</p>
<p>
Further configuration options can be found in the <a class="wiki" href="Configuration.html">runtime configuration</a> documentation.
</p>
<h3 id="noJQueryVariant">noJQuery Variant</h3>
<p>
When applications already include jQuery and/or want to use a different version than the one integrated into UI5, they can do so with the <tt>resources/sap-ui-core-noJQuery.js</tt> module. It requires that jQuery and jquery-ui-position have been loaded already.
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    <span class="o">&lt;!--</span> include some jQuery version <span class="o">--&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span>script src<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"my-jQuery-min.js"</span> <span class="o">&gt;&lt;/</span>script<span class="o">&gt;</span>

    <span class="o">&lt;!--</span> application doesn<span class="err">'</span>t have its own jquery<span class="o">-</span>ui<span class="o">-</span>position<span class="o">,</span> so it might use the one from UI5 <span class="o">--&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span>script src<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"resources/sap/ui/thirdparty/jqueryui/jquery-ui-position.js"</span> <span class="o">&gt;&lt;/</span>script<span class="o">&gt;</span>

    <span class="o">&lt;!--</span> now booting UI5 <span class="o">--&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span>script 
            id<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sap-ui-bootstrap"</span>            
            src<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"resources/sap-ui-core-nojQuery.js"</span> 
            data<span class="o">-</span>sap<span class="o">-</span>ui<span class="o">-</span>libs<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sap.ui.commons"</span>
            data<span class="o">-</span>sap<span class="o">-</span>ui<span class="o">-</span>theme<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sap_goldreflection"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;/</span>script<span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div><h3 id="PreloadVariant">Preload Variant</h3>
<p>
With the preload feature, all JavaScript modules for a library are loaded in adavance with a single request. But the code for the modules is not executed in the browser. Only when the module is required by the application, then the runtime executes the code once. Using this preload mechanism helps to significantly reduce the number of roundtrips. To use the preload feature, the 'preload' configuration option can be used. It can have three values: 
</p>
<ul><li><strong><tt>sync</tt></strong> loads the modules for all declared libraries in a sychronous manner. After the bootstrap tag has been processed, all preload files for all libraries have been loaded and the libraries have been initialized as usual. Using the 'preload=sync' mode should be transparent to most applications.
</li><li><strong><tt>async</tt></strong> loads the modules for all declared libraries in an asynchronous manner. So any code after the SAPUI5 bootstrap tag cannot be sure that the UI5 classes are available already. Applications that want to use the 'preload=async' mode must delay access to UI5 APIs with the help of the Core.attachInitEvent method. Only then it is save to access UI5 APIs. The asynchronous loading is only supported for the declared libraries (those loaded by the UI5 core). Libraries loaded dynamically (using the <tt>sap.ui.getCore().loadLibrary()</tt> API) will be preloaded in <tt>sync</tt> mode.
</li><li><strong><tt>auto</tt></strong> this is the default preload mode, if nothing else is configured. It checks whether the UI5 runtime uses optimized sources. If so, it enables the 'sync' mode to further optimize the runtime. When normal or debug sources are used, the preload is deactivated.
</li></ul><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> Preload sources are always optimized, so using preload in the debug mode of UI5 would be counter productive. Therefore the debug mode always overrides the preload mode.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to check the preload feature with an existing application is to specify the <tt>sap-ui-preload=</tt><em>mode</em> parameter in the start URL or to add the <tt>data-sap-ui-preload</tt> attribute to the bootstrap tag:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    <span class="o">&lt;</span>script 
            id<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sap-ui-bootstrap"</span>            
            src<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"resources/sap-ui-core.js"</span> 
            data<span class="o">-</span>sap<span class="o">-</span>ui<span class="o">-</span>libs<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sap.ui.commons"</span>
            data<span class="o">-</span>sap<span class="o">-</span>ui<span class="o">-</span>theme<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sap_goldreflection"</span> 
            data<span class="o">-</span>sap<span class="o">-</span>ui<span class="o">-</span>preload<span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"sync"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;/</span>script<span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> as the <tt>async</tt> mode requires active cooperation of the application, it is not activated automatically, only by configuration.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> the preload mode can be combined with other bootstrap modules as well (e.g. <tt>sap-ui-core-noJQuery</tt>).
</p>
<h3 id="all-in-oneperLibraryVariant">all-in-one per Library Variant</h3>
<p>
The all-in-one variant has a similar request behavior as the preload=sync, but it immediately executes all code for a library. Historically, it is a predecessor of the preload feature and should no longer be used.
</p>
<h3 id="sap-ui5">sap-ui5</h3>
<p>
Another predecessor of the 'preload' variant. It loads all classes and controls for the 4 standard UI5 libraries <tt>sap.ui.core</tt>, <tt>sap.ui.commons</tt>, <tt>sap.ui.table</tt>, <tt>sap.ui.ux3</tt> with one single request. While this sounds good at a first glance, it has several disadvantages:
</p>
<ul><li>set of libraries is not extensible. Custom libs don't benefit from this approach. They are loaded using the all-in.one variant before.
</li><li>all contained code is executed, which might increase the initial startup time of the application. Depends on other factors like browser, client computer / device etc.
</li><li>file is quite huge 
</li></ul><p>
Current suggestion is to use the preload variant, if any (remember that the preload is automatically chosen for optimized sources).
</p>
<h2 id="RuntimeBehaviorofBootstrap">Runtime Behavior of Bootstrap</h2>
<p>
When the SAPUI5 runtime is initialized, the following important steps are executed 
</p>
<ul><li>jQuery is enriched with a few plugins (most of them in the namespace <tt>jQuery.sap</tt>). These plugins provide fundamental functionality used by the rest of the UI5 core, namely the modularization concept, a small logging framework, performance measurement etc.
</li><li>the global object <tt>sap</tt> is created if it doesn't exist already
</li><li>the SAPUI5 Core class (<tt>sap.ui.core.Core</tt>) and all its dependencies are executed.
</li><li>the runtime configuration is determined from different sources
</li><li>all libraries and modules declared in the configuration as well as their dependencies are loaded
</li><li>for each loaded library, the stylesheet  for the configured theme is added to the page
</li><li>when loading the libraries has finished and when the document becomes ready, the initEvent of the core is fired and all registered handlers are executed
</li></ul><h3 id="StepsduringLibraryLoading">Steps during Library Loading</h3>
<p>
For each control library that has to be loaded during bootstrap, the runtime loads and interprets the following additional resources:
</p>
<ul><li>a library bootstrap file <tt>/''context-path''/resources/''library-name''/library.js</tt>
</li></ul><blockquote>
<p>
A JavaScript file that contains the JavaScript code for all enumeration types provided by the library as well as library specific initialization code that is independent from any controls in the library. The file must call the sap.ui.getCore().initLibrary method with an object that describes the content of the library (list of contained controls, elements etc.). For libraries that are developed with the SAPUI5 Toolset or build with the SAPUI5 offline build tools, this file is automatically generated during build.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>a library stylesheet file <tt>/''context-path''/resources/''library-name''/themes/''theme-name''/library.css</tt>
</li></ul><blockquote>
<p>
A standard CSS file that contains all styles relevant for this library. For libraries that are developed with the SAPUI5 Toolset, this file is automatically generated during build.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="DynamicLoadingofUILibraries">Dynamic Loading of UI Libraries</h3>
<p>
Declaring UI libraries in the runtime configuration is just one way to use a library at runtime. Another way is to use the <tt>sap.ui.getCore().loadLibrary()</tt> at runtime to instruct UI5 to load an additional library. After loading the library, all controls from that library can be used as well, but the same restriction as for declared libaries (DOM access only after document.ready and rendering) apply.
