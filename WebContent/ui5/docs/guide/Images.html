<h2 id="SupportingDifferentPixelDensities">Supporting Different Pixel Densities</h2>
<p>
Some mobile devices, starting with iPhone4 and iPad3, have a display with a very high density of pixels (four pixels where older models would only have one pixel). Apple calls those "Retina displays" to suggest they are as crispand clear as the eye can see. They use four physical pixels to display one logical CSS pixel, so images can be displayed much sharper when given twice as large as usually required because internally the device can use much more pixels to display all details of the image. Browsers on those displays do this automatically when images are scaled down.
</p>
<p>
So some devices support higher resolution images while others do not. It is therefore recommended for SAPUI5 application developers to provide image resources FOR ALL RELEVANT densities to provide a very crisp and clear display of images on devices with "retina display". 
</p>
<p>
The <tt>sap.m.Image</tt> control automatically chooses the right density, depending on the device on which it is displayed. If an image of a certain density is not available, the image controls falls back to a default image, which should be provided as well. Please be aware that the image control is also used implicitly by other mobile controls, e.g.
</p>
<ul><li>Button
</li><li>Segmented Button
</li><li>Standard List Item
</li></ul><p>
<img src="alert.png" style="vertical-align: bottom" alt="/!\" /> If you do not have higher resolution images you should set the 'densityAware' property to false to avoid unnecessary roundtrips.
</p>
<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>
<p>
Assume the following controls are displayed on a device with high-density screen (<tt>window.devicePixelRatio</tt> is 2):
</p>
<pre class="wiki">
new sap.m.Image({ 
	densityAware: false, // tell the image control that there are no different optimized image variants
	src : "first.png"   // therefore Image control will directly load first.png 
})

new sap.m.Image({ 
	src : "second.png"    // Image control will first look for second@2.png, then fall back to second.png
})
</pre><p>
The first Image control has been told that there are no image files for the different densities, so it will directly load "first.png". This image will look as good as other images on retina displays.
<br />
The second Image control will first attempt to load "<a class="mail-link" href="mailto:second@2.png"><span class="icon"> </span>second@2.png</a>" which should be twice as large as the normal image and would be scaled down for display, so it looks absolutely crisp on retina displays. If this file does not exist, it will fall back to "second.png", but this fallback will cause an additional server request.
</p>
<h2 id="NamingConventions">Naming Conventions</h2>
<p>
Density related images will be loaded if image with density awareness name in following format is provided.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">[imageName]@[densityValue].[extension]
</pre><p>
Currently, the densities <del>0.75,</del> 1.5 and 2 are supported. Here's an example of a set of images with different densities:
</p>
<ul><li>detail.png (default)
</li><li><del>detail@0.75.png</del> (not supported any more, will use the standard image for such low density device)
</li><li>detail@1.5.png
</li><li>detail@2.png
</li></ul>
