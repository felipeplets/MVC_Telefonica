<h1 id="HowtocreateanewSAPUI5Controlin19seconds">How to create a new SAPUI5 Control in 19 seconds</h1>
<p>
This page explains <strong>how to create a new SAPUI5 Control and use it in a simple UI5 application - from scratch within 19 seconds</strong> (with some practice&hellip;).<br />
</p>
<ul><li>If you are interested in exactly doing this without reading too much, you can <strong>jump right <a class="wiki" href="OnTheFlyControlExample.html#Andhowtodoitin19seconds">down to the respective section</a></strong> on this page.<br />
</li><li>If you prefer a solid introduction, the <a class="wiki" href="OnTheFlyControlDefinition.html">complete documentation</a> might be better suited. There you will also find <strong>more examples for new and extended Controls</strong>.
</li></ul><p>
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="Explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
This page assumes you have seen and understood the <a class="wiki" href="HelloWorld.html">SAPUI5 Hello World in 20 seconds</a> example, so you are familiar with how UI5 is loaded, how controls are instantiated and how they are added to the HTML page.<br />
This page therefore only explains the parts specific to the definition/creation of new Controls.
</p>
<p>
Controls can also be defined and implemented using the SAPUI5 Eclipse plug-ins, which add a lot of useful functionality and a more integrated perspective with Form-based Control API editor, Code validation, CSS processing (like automatic right-to-left generation) etc. <br />
But all these features are optional and Controls created as shown on this page are technically equivalent to Eclipse-defined controls. 
</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<h3 id="WhatisaControl">What is a Control?</h3>
<p>
A Control is an object that defines the appearance and behavior of a screen area.
</p>
<ul><li>A Control instance typically has <strong>properties</strong> like "text" or "width" that modify the appearance or relate to the data displayed by the Control.
</li><li>It can <strong>aggregate</strong> other Controls. This means it is a sort of <i>container</i> or <i>layout</i> Control when the application can define the child controls to use - or a <i>composite</i> Control if the Control itself decides what the child Controls are and just re-uses these available components.
</li><li>It can also have <strong>associated</strong> Controls that are not part or children of this Control, but rather loosely related.
</li><li>And finally a Control can fire well-defined <strong>events</strong>. Typically, these have a meaning that relates to the Control's purpose and functionality and is on a semantically higher level than "click" or other browser events. Examples would be "triggerSearch" in a SearchField or "collapse" in a Panel.
</li></ul><p>
<tt>sap.ui.core.Control</tt> is the base class of all UI5 Controls. Controls can either inherit from this base class or from another Control, in order to inherit and extend its functionality.
</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<h3 id="DefiningaControl">Defining a Control</h3>
<p>
In this example we want to create a new Control from scratch, without inheriting from an existing Control (which would also be possible).
</p>
<p>
This Control we develop is <strong>a square with a text inside</strong>. The text and the width/height of the square should be configurable.
</p>
<p>
The key to defining a new Control is the <tt>extend</tt> method which is available on all Controls to define a sub-class. Its arguments are
</p>
<ol><li>the name of the new Control class
</li><li>the definition and implementation of the new Control class
</li></ol><p>
<strong>Note</strong>: if you know <tt>jQuery.extend(target, source)</tt>, this might be surprising on first glance as the base class is <strong>not</strong> modified/enriched (but a new class is created). But in fact <tt>sap.ui.core.Control.extend(controlName, controlImpl)</tt> also enriches the first argument by the second one, so they behave quite equal. 
</p>
<p>
The Control should be named "Square" and reside in a (virtual) library called "my". So we start writing:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="c1">// PART 1: define a new (simple) Control type
</span>sap<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">ui</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">core</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Control</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">extend</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"my.Square"</span><span class="o">,</span> 
</pre></div><p>
The Control definition/implementation object is a JSON structure defining 
</p>
<ol><li>the metadata of the Control (which properties, aggregations, events does it have?)
</li><li>any methods the control class should have
</li><li>in particular the "renderer" function that is responsible for creating the Control HTML structure
</li></ol><p>
<br />
</p>
<h4 id="ControlAPIMetadata">Control API/Metadata</h4>
<p>
So the Control metadata of our square defines two properties and their types:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>   metadata <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">{</span>
      properties <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">{</span>           <span class="c1">// setter and getter are created behind the scenes, incl. data binding and type validation
</span>         <span class="s">"text"</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="s">"string"</span><span class="o">,</span>    <span class="c1">// in simple cases, just define the type
</span>         <span class="s">"size"</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="nl">type:</span> <span class="s">"sap.ui.core.CSSSize"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nl">defaultValue:</span> <span class="s">"200px"</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="c1">// you can also give a default value and more
</span>      <span class="o">}</span>
   <span class="o">},</span>
</pre></div><p>
<br />
</p>
<h4 id="ControlRenderer">Control Renderer</h4>
<p>
The renderer of the control is a function that writes a &lt;div&gt; element, adds the Control size as style and writes the Control text into the &lt;div&gt;.<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: <tt>oRm</tt> is the "<a class="missing wiki">RenderManager?</a>", a part of the UI5 core that is responsible for efficiently collecting and injecting HTML. This method is static, so it cannot use "this", but needs to use the given <tt>oControl</tt> instance.
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    <span class="c1">// the part creating the HTML:
</span>    renderer <span class="o">:</span> function<span class="o">(</span>oRm<span class="o">,</span> oControl<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="c1">// static function, so use the given "oControl" instance instead of "this" in the renderer function
</span>        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">write</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"&lt;div"</span><span class="o">);</span> 
        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">writeControlData</span><span class="o">(</span>oControl<span class="o">);</span>  <span class="c1">// writes the Control ID and enables event handling - important!
</span>        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addStyle</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"width"</span><span class="o">,</span> oControl<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getSize</span><span class="o">());</span>  <span class="c1">// write the Control property size; the Control has validated it to be a CSS size
</span>        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addStyle</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"height"</span><span class="o">,</span> oControl<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getSize</span><span class="o">());</span>
        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">writeStyles</span><span class="o">();</span>
        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">addClass</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"mySquare"</span><span class="o">);</span>        <span class="c1">// add a CSS class for styles common to all control instances
</span>        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">writeClasses</span><span class="o">();</span>              <span class="c1">// this call writes the above class plus enables support for Square.addStyleClass(...)
</span>        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">write</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"&gt;"</span><span class="o">);</span>
        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">writeEscaped</span><span class="o">(</span>oControl<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getText</span><span class="o">());</span> <span class="c1">// write another Control property, with escaping for cross-site-scripting protection
</span>        oRm<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">write</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"&lt;/div&gt;"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="o">},</span>
</pre></div><p>
This notation appears to be a bit verbose, in particular how styles and CSS classes are first collected and then flushed to the <a class="missing wiki">RenderManager?</a>. In fact you could make it shorter by e.g. writing the CSS class just saying <tt>oRm.write(" class='mySquare'");</tt> and apllying a similar shortcut for the style. With more complex Controls, however, and many different if-else branches that check aspects of the current Control state, using such a collector functionality is very helpful.<br />
And if you want to enable the application to add custom style classes to your Control, the <tt>writeClasses()</tt> call is actually required (and sufficient).
</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<h4 id="EventHandler">Event Handler</h4>
<p>
Finally, the control implementation gets an event handler that responds to the mouse click event. It accesses the text of the clicked Control instance and displays it in an alert box:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    <span class="c1">// an event handler:
</span>    onclick <span class="o">:</span> function<span class="o">(</span>evt<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>   <span class="c1">// is called when the Control's area is clicked - no event registration required
</span>        alert<span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Control clicked! Text of the Control is:\n"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getText</span><span class="o">());</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div><p>
<br />
</p>
<h4 id="ControlStyle">Control Style</h4>
<p>
The control definition and implementation is finished now, but some styling remains to be done.<br />
The visual appearance could have been written to the Control HTML in the renderer method, just like the instance-specific width and height was written. But it is better to define style that is common to all control instances in a CSS file, or at least in a &lt;style&gt; tag, so it only needs to be written once and it can be easily modified by the application.<br />
So we add a grey background, a red border and some alignment stuff:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nt">style</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nc">.mySquare</span> <span class="p">{</span>                  <span class="c">/* style the CSS class that has been written by the renderer method */</span>
        <span class="k">display</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">inline</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">block</span><span class="p">;</span>   <span class="c">/* enable squares to appear next to each other within one line */</span>
        <span class="k">border</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1px</span> <span class="k">solid</span> <span class="nb">red</span><span class="p">;</span>   <span class="c">/* add some border, so the square can actually be seen */</span>
        <span class="k">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">#ddd</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="k">padding</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">8px</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="k">text-align</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">center</span><span class="p">;</span>
        box<span class="o">-</span>sizing<span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">border</span><span class="o">-</span>box<span class="p">;</span> <span class="c">/* consider padding+border part of the width/height */</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">style</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>
Now the Control is completely done: it is defined, implemented, styled, and ready to be used.
</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<h3 id="UsingtheControlinanApplication">Using the Control in an Application</h3>
<p>
Once the Control is defined as above, it can be used right away, just like any other UI5 Control. Let's create and display two instances:
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>    <span class="c1">// PART 2: instantiate Control and place it onto the page
</span>    var myControl <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> my<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Square</span><span class="o">({</span><span class="nl">text:</span><span class="s">"Hello"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nl">size:</span> <span class="s">"100px"</span><span class="o">});</span>
    myControl<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">placeAt</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"content"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    
    <span class="c1">// ok, add another instance...:
</span>    <span class="k">new</span> my<span class="o">.</span><span class="na">Square</span><span class="o">({</span><span class="nl">text:</span><span class="s">"Me too!"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nl">size:</span> <span class="s">"80px"</span><span class="o">}).</span><span class="na">placeAt</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"content"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</pre></div><p>
That's it.

Assumption for these instructions to work exactly as described: you have a Windows Computer (other OS will work similarly), Internet Explorer 8+ (having the security option: access data across domains turned on for the proper zone), FireFox 13+, Safari 5+ or Chrome 20+ and you know where you can refer to SAPUI5 on some server.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Important:</strong> the URL in the script tag is pre-filled as "<a class="ext-link" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js"><span class="icon"> </span>https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js</a>" (which was at least available at the time of writing this document).

You could now&hellip;
</p>
<ul><li>&hellip;make the Control render more complex HTML
</li><li>&hellip;add more properties and use their values in the renderer function
</li><li>&hellip;verify that property validation works by setting the size to an invalid value like "boo!"
</li><li>&hellip;use data binding to fill the Control properties
</li><li>&hellip;add an aggregation, so you can put another control into the square
</li></ul><p>
