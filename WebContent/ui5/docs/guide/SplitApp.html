<p>
When developing applications for tablets, for example the iPad or Google Nexus7, we need to make good use of the extra available space compared to smartphones.<br />
Porting existing mobile apps to tablets will lead to a lot of unused space, since the tablet will display the app.<br />
</p>
<p>
One of the most used patterns to address this is called the "Master-Detail" pattern which is also often used in native iOS and Android development. <br />
Good examples are the native "Settings" and "E-Mail" applications of iOS and Android tablets. This pattern can be used with the SplitApp control.<br />
</p>
<p>
The image below shows the basic idea of this pattern. The app is divided in two views, the Master and Detail view. <br />
The Master is used as the main navigation of the application. It mostly presents a list of items whereas the detail view then presents the detail of the selected item. <br />
</p>
<p>
<img src="splitapp_pattern.PNG" />
</p>
<p>
On a mobile devices the selection of an item would instead navigate the user to the detail page. So on a tablet the user can see the list of items and the detail view at the same time. <br />
This will be different if the tablet device is used in portrait mode, since the tablet will have less available space in width. <br />
Hence we need to decide how we deal with the reduced with. <br />
Therefore the <a class="missing wiki">SplitApp?</a> control provides three different modes how to display the master and detail view when the device is in portrait mode:<br />
</p>
<ul><li><strong>ShowHideMode</strong><br />
This is the default mode, which will hide the master view automatically when the user switches the device into portrait mode. <br />
To show the master view the user can swipe right on the detail view or use the button which will be placed in the header of the detail view. <br />
The master then will slide in from the right. The user can then chose another list item, which will update the detail view and automatically hides the master view again.<br />
</li></ul><ul><li><strong>PopoverMode</strong><br />
This mode will place the master view inside a Popover, which can be opened via the button in the header of the detail view.<br />
</li></ul><ul><li><strong>StretchCompressMode</strong><br />
This is the only mode where master is shown in both the portrait and landscape mode of the device. Hence the detail view will have less space when in portait mode.<br />
</li></ul><p>
All modes however will always show the master view when the device is in landscape mode.<br /><br />
</p>
<p>
So, do we need to develop two applications? One for mobile devices and one for tablet devices? The good news is when a SplitApp is run on a mobile device, <br />
it automatically behaves like a standard mobile application. The difference can be seen in the image below: <br /><br />
</p>
<p>
<img src="splitapp_mobile.PNG" />
</p>
<p>
Since we can only show one page per screen our master and detail view will automatically be shown on separate pages and the standard page navigation will be applied.
</p>
<p>
Now lets build our first SplitApp application.
</p>
<h2 id="ThefirstSplitApp">The first SplitApp</h2>
<p>
In order to develop a SplitApp application we will use sap.m.SplitApp instead of the sap.m.App control which is used for smartphone applications only.<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">var oSplitApp = new sap.m.SplitApp("mySplitApp", {});
</pre><p>
As with the App control, we can add pages to our control but we have to decide to which view we want to add them:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">oSplitApp.addDetail() or oSplitApp.addMaster();
</pre><p>
But first we need some basic pages, two for our master and two for our detail view:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">var oDetailPage1 = new sap.m.Page("detail1", {
   title : "Detail 1",
   content : [ new sap.m.Label({
		 text : "this is Detail 1"
               }) 
	     ]
});

var oDetailPage2 = new sap.m.Page("detail2", {
   title : "Detail 2",
   content : [ new sap.m.Label({
		 text : "this is Detail 2"
               }) 
	     ]
});
</pre><p>
The two master pages need a list so we can implement a basic navigation and to select our detail view. <br />
We will use a simple StandardListItem with the type "Navigation", since we want to navigate or "drill down" only inside our master view. <br />
So when the user taps on our list item we want to navigate to master page 2. <br />
To do so we call the method toMaster() and the page we want to navigate to, in our example it is "master2".
</p>
<pre class="wiki">var oMasterPage1 = new sap.m.Page("master1",{
   title : "Master",
   content : [ new sap.m.List({
		items : [ new sap.m.StandardListItem({
			title : "To Master 2",
			type : "Navigation",
			press : function() {
				oSplitApp.toMaster("master2");
			}
		})]
	}) ]
});
</pre><p>
Our second master page will be the leaf point of our master navigation, because now we want to update our detail view, depending on which list item the user is pressing. <br />
An example would be a mail application where the list is a list of emails and the display view would then show the mail's content. <br />
That is why we set the mode of our list to "SingleSelectMaster", since we do not want any further navigation inside the master view. <br />
To update the detail view we have to listen to the list's select events, so we can decide on which detail page to show. <br />
Depending on the selected list item we will show either page "detail1" or "detail2". Hence we call the method toDetail, since we want to navigate inside our detail view.<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">var oMasterPage2 = new sap.m.Page("master2",{
   title : "Master2",
   navButtonPress : function() {
		   oSplitApp.backMaster();
	          },
   content : [ new sap.m.List({
		mode:"SingleSelectMaster",
		select: function(oEv) {
			   if(oEv.getParameter("listItem").getId() == "listDetail2") {
			      oSplitApp.toDetail("detail2");
			}else {
			      oSplitApp.toDetail("detail1");
			}
		},
		items : [ new sap.m.StandardListItem("listDetail2",{
			      title : "To Detail 2"
			}), new sap.m.StandardListItem("listDetail",{
			     title : "To Detail 1"
		}) ]
	}) ]
});
</pre><p>
In order to make our SplitApp also run on mobile devices we need to add some more information to our pages.<br />
Therefore we have to make sure we can navigate back from any detail page to the master page.
</p>
<p>
Now we can set everything together and put our pages to the SplitApp control:<br />
</p>
<pre class="wiki">//add the master pages to the splitapp control
oSplitApp.addMasterPage(oMasterPage1).addMasterPage(oMasterPage2);

//add the detail pages to the splitapp control
oSplitApp.addDetailPage(oDetailPage1).addDetailPage(oDetailPage2);

</pre><p>
To set the initial master and detail page, which are shown first when the app launches, we can need to call:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">oSplitApp.setInitialDetail("detail");
oSplitApp.setInitialMaster("master");
</pre><p>
We also can define what kind of page transition we want to use. For more information, see the documentation for the NavContainer.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">oSplitApp.setDefaultTransitionNameDetail("fade");
</pre><p>
Finally we place our SplitApp control to the HTML body tag:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">oSplitApp.placeAt("body");
</pre><p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
This link provides a sample SplitApp application : <a class="ext-link" href="../../content/apps/mobile/splitapp/index.html?sap-ui-xx-fakeOS=android_tablet"><span class="icon"> </span>SplitApp Demo</a>
</p>
<p>
<br />
To test the other two SplitApp modes we can set the them via this method:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">oSplitApp.setMode("PopoverMode");
//or
oSplitApp.setMode("StretchCompressMode");
</pre>

    </div>
    
  </body>
