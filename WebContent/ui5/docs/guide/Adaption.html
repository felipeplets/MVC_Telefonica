<h1 id="AdaptingtoPlatformandFormFactors">Adapting to Platform and Form Factors</h1>
<p>
The SAPUI5 Mobile library targets devices running different operating systems and having very different screen sizes and pixel densities.
SAPUI5 does some adaptations automatically and applications may wish to adapt to the current device even beyond this scope.<br />
This page gives an overview of what is done by SAPUI5 and what the application can do in addition.
</p>
<h2 id="Built-inAdaptationofSAPUI5Mobile">Built-in Adaptation of SAPUI5 Mobile</h2>
<h3 id="Platform-dependentStyling">Platform-dependent Styling</h3>
<p>
The "sap_mvi" ("Mobile Visual Identity") theme delivered with the SAPUI5 Mobile library provides three different visual styles which closely mimic the native look of the Apple iOS, the Android and the Windows Phone platform. Compared to the native visuals they are adapted to match the SAP color scheme with black and golden color accents.
</p>
<ul><li>The iOS design has the typical Apple gradients and rounded corners, but is tinted in black and grey with golden accents. 
</li><li>The Android design is using the Android 4.0 ("Ice Cream Sandwich") design as base with rather flat elements with no gradients or rounded corners. While the ICS design already has Black as a base color, the MVI theme adds golden accents while maintaining Google's original blue style in the interactive controls
</li><li>The Windows Phone design mimics the typical chrome-less visuals, but does not adapt the entire interaction to feel 100% native
</li></ul><p>
The controls look very much like the native UI controls on these platforms, so the user immediately recognizes them.
</p>
<p>
On BlackBerry 10 currently the Android look and feel is used.
</p>
<p>
<img src="alert.png" style="vertical-align: bottom" alt="/!\" /> <strong>The theme 'SAP Mobile Visual Identity' is outdated. All new controls and control extensions since the 1.12 release do not support it. Also it is not supported for the platforms: iOS7 and Android 4.3. With the 1.20 release it will be removed from sap.m. Use the 'SAP Blue Crystal' theme instead that is supported for all controls and supported platforms.</strong>
</p>
<h3 id="OtherPlatform-dependentAdaptations">Other Platform-dependent Adaptations</h3>
<p>
The SAPUI5 Mobile library provides platform adaptations beyond the sheer visual design. To a certain degree controls automatically adapt to the native UI concepts and user experience without any effort on application side.
</p>
<p>
Examples for this are:
</p>
<ul><li>The <tt>sap.m.Page</tt> control by default creates a header which looks different on both platforms even though there is only one single Page API:
<ul><li>On iOS the navigation button is the typical Apple back button having a label and an arrow shape on the left side and the header title is in the center
</li><li>On Android the navigation button appears as just an arrow with no label, there is an optional icon displayed next to it, and the header title is displayed left-aligned
</li><li>On Windows Phone there is never a back navigation button. Instead, the phone's hardware button is used for back navigation.
</li></ul></li><li>The <tt>sap.m.SegmentedButton</tt> looks like a tab when being used in a bar on Android.
</li><li>The <tt>sap.m.Dialog</tt> appearance not only differs between operating systems, but also between form factors:
<ul><li>On Android it is a bright popup with buttons filling the whole popup footer
</li><li>On iPad it is a Popup with dark header and buttons in the left and right side of the header
</li><li>On iPhone it looks like on iPad, but it covers the full screen and is sliding in from the bottom
</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="TheSplitAppControl-adaptingautomaticallytodifferentformfactors">The SplitApp Control - adapting automatically to different form factors</h3>
<p>
The <tt>sap.m.!SplitApp</tt> control can be used to implement multi-page scenarios that automatically adapt to the available screen size: on phones only one page is displayed, on tablets, especially in landscape orientation, two pages are displayed simultaneously. It is described in more detail <a class="wiki" href="SplitApp.html">here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="OptionsforfurtherAdaptation">Options for further Adaptation</h2>
<p>
Beyond the adaptations done automatically by SAPUI5, the application can choose to do much more platform adaptations. UI5 provides a variety of detection mechanisms and markers to make this easy:
</p>
<h3 id="MobilevsDesktopandPhonevsTablet">Mobile vs Desktop and Phone vs Tablet</h3>
<p>
How can an application detect whether it is on a Mobile device?<br />
This is not easy to answer as the border gets blurs more and more: there are now desktop computers supporting touch operation, tablets where keyboards can be attached and even laptops where you can detach the screen which gives you a tablet. So where is the border? There is no clear separation.<br />
But depending on your own definition of the border you can detect e.g. touch capabilities by checking
</p>
<pre class="wiki">var isTouchDevice = jQuery.support.touch;
</pre><p>
Based on this check there is also the following flag provided by UI5:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">var runningOnDesktop = jQuery.device.is.desktop;
</pre><p>
Similarly, when not running on desktop browsers, one of the following is true:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">var runningOnTablet = jQuery.device.is.tablet;
var runningOnPhone = jQuery.device.is.phone;
</pre><p>
On iOS the separation is clear, on Android the border between these classes is assumed to be at 600 pixels virtual screen width.
</p>
<p>
For your CSS, the same information is available on the html root tag as one of these three CSS classes:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">sap-desktop
sap-tablet
sap-phone
</pre><p>
So you can provide style for the phone case using CSS cascades as follows:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">.sap-phone .myControl {
      font-size: small;
}
</pre><p>
Note that when using the "fakeOS" device simulation on desktop browsers, the platform will be recognized as either "tablet" or "phone".
</p>
<p>
You might also consider checking the screen size (using media queries in CSS or the browser/jQuery APIS in JavaScript) or the presence of certain APIs or features.
</p>
<p>
Further information in the <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/jQuery.device.is.html" title="symbols/jQuery.device.is.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>jQuery.device.is</a> object includes:
</p>
<ul><li>iphone, ipad: flags whether the application runs on either of them
</li></ul><h3 id="iOSvsAndroidandVersionInformationasJavaScriptAPI">iOS vs Android and Version Information (as JavaScript API)</h3>
<p>
The <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/jQuery.os.html" title="symbols/jQuery.os.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>jQuery.os</a> object holds information about the operating system:
</p>
<ul><li>os: the operating system as string ("ios", "android", "winphone", or "blackberry")
</li><li>ios, android, winphone, blackberry: boolean flags for the respective platform
</li><li>version: the operating system version as string
</li><li>fVersion: the operating system version as float
</li></ul><h3 id="iOSvsAndroidvsWindowsPhonevsBlackBerry-andVersionInformationforCSSstyling">iOS vs Android vs Windows Phone vs BlackBerry - and Version Information (for CSS styling)</h3>
<p>
Platform and browser version information is also added to the root element (the &lt;html&gt; element of the page) by UI5. There are three distinct packages of information:
</p>
<ul><li>The CSS class "sap-ios", "sap-android", "sap-winphone", or "sap-bb" (for BlackBerry) is added for easy platform-dependent styling
</li><li>The attribute "data-sap-ui-browser" is added, providing more information about browser and version
</li><li>The attribute "data-sap-ui-os" is added, providing more information about operating system and version
</li></ul><p>
The CSS class can be used directly in cascades, the other two need attribute selectors which can also be used to match substrings:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">.sap-ios .myControl {
   color: red;  /* make my control red on Apple devices only */
}

html[data-sap-ui-browser*=msf] .myControl {
   background-color: blue;  /* Control should have a blue background whenever Mobile Safari is running... */
}

html[data-sap-ui-os="iOS5.0"] .myControl {
   background-color: green;  /* ...but when running on an Apple device with version 5.0 of the operating system, it should rather be green */
}
</pre><p>
You can find more details <a class="wiki" href="PlatformAttribute.html">here</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="OrientationandChangeofOrientation">Orientation and Change of Orientation</h3>
<p>
The <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/jQuery.device.is.html" title="symbols/jQuery.device.is.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>jQuery.device.is</a> object also includes orientation information:
</p>
<ul><li>landscape: flag whether the current orientation is landscape
</li><li>portrait: flag whether the current orientation is portrait
</li></ul><p>
When the orientation is changed because the user rotates the device, the "orientationchange" event is fired by the browser, so you can handle this case as well.
This event seems to be delayed in some cases, so the <a class="ext-link" href="../api/symbols/sap.m.App.html" title="symbols/sap.m.App.html in Merged JSDoc"><span class="icon"> </span>sap.m.App</a> control also fires its own "orientationChange" event based on the browser's window resize event (which on mobile devices happens when the orientation is changed):
</p>
<pre class="wiki">myApp.attachOrientationChange(function(evt) {
   if (evt.getParameters().landscape) {
      // do something...
   }
});
</pre><p>
In CSS you can use CSS media queries to check this.
