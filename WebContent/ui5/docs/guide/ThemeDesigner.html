<p>
Theme Designer is an application which creates custom themes for SAPUI5 applications based on a set of predefined theme parameters.<br />
</p>
<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
Any SAPUI5 Application based on the core release 1.6.x or higher can be used within the Theme Designer. Certain features are only available with applications based on 1.8.x or later. This includes, but is not limited to, parameter scopes (such as quick or expert parameters).<br />
</p>
<p>
The Theme Designer and the application which should be loaded within <strong>must both be available on the same domain</strong> (Same-Origin-Policy).<br />
</p>
<h2 id="Features">Features</h2>
<p>
By specifying a URL to your SAPUI5 application, the Theme Designer will load a list of available theme parameters given the set of included SAPUI5 libraries. Changing the parameters will update the application in real-time.<br />
</p>
<p>
All parameter changes can be saved to the browser's local storage and will be available for a reload.<br />
</p>
<p>
Custom CSS can be added andwill be reflected in the application preview in real-time.<br />
</p>
<p>
The resulting theme along with any custom CSS can also be saved to the user's file system as a ZIP file.<br />
</p>

<h1 id="Details">Details</h1>
<h2 id="Loadinganapplication">Loading an application</h2>
<p>
Specify the URL to your application on the start page of the Theme Designer and press the load button. The application will attempt to load all included theme parameters according to the SAPUI5 libraries available within the application (loaded via bootstrap configuration).<br />
</p>
<h2 id="Changingparametervalues">Changing parameter values</h2>
<p>
All parameters can be reached via the sections "Quick" or "Expert" depending on their definition. Changes to the value of a parameter will cause an update of the application preview in real-time upon submitting the value.<br />
</p>
<p>
All color values can be manipulated using the Color Picker. Simply press the color preview to open this tool and manipulate the color value in either RGB or HSV color space.
</p>
<h3 id="Viewingchanges">Viewing changes</h3>
<p>
All changes made to theme parameters are available in the section "Change Log".
</p>
<h3 id="Resettingchanges">Resetting changes</h3>
<p>
Any change can be reset by selecting this entry in the "Change Log" section and clicking the "Reset" button in the toolbar above.
</p>
<h2 id="CustomCSS">Custom CSS</h2>
<p>
Specify custom CSS which should be integrated into the application preview. The preview will be refreshed as soon as the changes are done. The custom CSS is applied after any other CSS elements specified in the HTML documents HEAD section. This data can thus be used to override any particular CSS rule.
</p>
<h2 id="Savinglocalstorage">Saving (local storage)</h2>
<p>
Changes to the current application preview due to parameter changes and custom CSS can be saved in the local browsers persistent storage (localStorage). Please note that this data might be erased by forcing a deletion of the browser's cache.
</p>
<h2 id="SavingZIP">Saving (ZIP)</h2>
<p>
The resulting theme along with the custom CSS specified within Theme Designer can be downloaded as a ZIP file. This feature is currently not supported for Internet Explorer. Please note that the downloaded file must be renamed to a .zip extension when using Mozilla Firefox.
</p>
<h3 id="ZIPfilecontents">ZIP file contents</h3>
<p>
The contents of the created ZIP file correspond to the file structure for theme libraries created by SAP. You can simply extract these files and make them available on a web server of your choice. In order for your application to consume this theme, please check the corresponding 
<a class="wiki" href="ThemingFAQ.html#WhenmycustomthemeislocatedelsewherehowcanIloadit">documentation</a>.
In addition to the theme library files, any custom CSS will also be included in the ZIP container.
