		<h2>Functional Overview</h2>

		<p>You sometimes want the user let transfer some files from the client to the server, for example
		for attaching them to an electronic mail. The FileUploader control combines the ease of use and configurable appearance
		of the library controls with the functionality of the &lt;input type="file"&gt; element. The required HTML &lt;form&gt; element,
		its encoding, and the target window for the submit response are managed under the hood.</p>

		<p>FileUploader consists of an editable TextField, containing the name of the currently selected file,
		and of a Button which opens the standard browser file selection dialog. When the user selects a
		file from the dialog, the file name will be displayed in the TextField again. The file upload can be
		triggered either automatically or using a method.</p>

		<h2>Examples</h2>

		<h3>Simple Uploader</h3>

		<p>To use the FileUploader, create a control instance, configure at least the upload URL and the name
		of the upload. The upload shall be triggered directly after the user has selected a file.</p>
		<br><br>

		<div code-sample="sample1" script="SimpleUseCase"></div>

		<script id='SimpleUseCase'>

		// create the FileUploader control
		var oSimpleFileUploader = new sap.ui.commons.FileUploader({
		uploadUrl : "../../../../../upload",   // URL to submit the form to
		name: "simpleUploader",          // name of the input type=file element within the form 
		uploadOnChange: true             // immediately upload the file after selection
		});
		// attach it to the page
		oSimpleFileUploader.placeAt("sample1");
		</script>

		<h3>Upload Check</h3>

		<p>To verify the results of the upload, check the following file list. It displays all
		files in the upload area (server side) of this application and is updated automatically.</p>
		<br><br>
		<div id="upload-check"></div>

		<h3>Explicitly Triggering an Upload</h3>

		<p>As mentioned already there are two ways to trigger the file upload, either automatically
		(as we have seen in the previous sample) or explicitly by calling the <code>upload()</code>
		method of the FileUploader control. You define the option to use using the <code>uploadOnChange</code>
		property. When the property is set to <code>false</code>, no automatic upload happens. Instead, the application
		has to trigger the upload any time later by calling the <code>upload()</code> method. This can for example be useful
		when multiple inputs have to be done before the upload takes place (for example for input of a
		server-side file name). The following sample illustrates the explicitly triggered upload.</p>

		<p>To check whether the Upload was successful a Return Code has to be generated by the server. This return code with an
		optional message has to be put into the HTML Response Document of the iFrame. Within the Response the return code and message
		should be put within the <code>body</code> tags of the document like this for example:
		<pre>
			&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;[200]:Upload successful!&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
		</pre>
		On the client side you have to respond to this response. In our example a Regular Expression is used to parse the response
		into the return code and the corresponding message: <code>var m = /^\[(\d\d\d)\]:(.*)$/.exec(sResponse);</code>
		Then a Success or Error Message Box can be shown accordingly. However this does not work in cross-domain scenarios.
		</p>

		<div code-sample="sample2" script="ManuallyTriggeredUploadScript"></div>
		<script id='ManuallyTriggeredUploadScript'>
		var layout = new sap.ui.commons.layout.MatrixLayout();
		layout.setLayoutFixed(false);

		// create the uploader and disable the automatic upload
		var oFileUploader2 = new sap.ui.commons.FileUploader({
		name: "upload2",
		uploadOnChange: false,
		uploadUrl: "../../../../../upload",
		uploadComplete: function (oEvent) {
			var sResponse = oEvent.getParameter("response");
			if (sResponse) {
				var m = /^\[(\d\d\d)\]:(.*)$/.exec(sResponse);
				if (m[1] == "200") {
					sap.ui.commons.MessageBox.show("Return Code: " + m[1] + "\n" + m[2], "SUCCESS", "Upload Success");
				} else {
					sap.ui.commons.MessageBox.show("Return Code: " + m[1] + "\n" + m[2], "ERROR", "Upload Error");
				}
			}
		}});
		layout.createRow(oFileUploader2);

		// create a second button to trigger the upload
		var oTriggerButton = new sap.ui.commons.Button({
		text:'Trigger Upload',
		press:function() {
		// call the upload method
		oFileUploader2.upload();
	}
});
layout.createRow(oTriggerButton);
layout.placeAt("sample2");
</script>

		<h3>Long File Names</h3>
		<p>
		To minimize issues with long file names, the FileUploader control always displays the base name
		and the extensions without the parent path. In the case the name is still too long, the name is (visually) truncated.
		The full file name including the path can be provided in the form of a tool tip.
		The following example also shows some width settings for the FileUploader control.
		Select a file with a long name and hover over the two FileUploader controls to see the tool tip.</p>
		<br><br>
		<div code-sample="sample3" script="SimpleFileUpload3"></div>
<script id='SimpleFileUpload3'>
var layout = new sap.ui.commons.layout.MatrixLayout();
layout.setLayoutFixed(false);
var oFileUploader3a = new sap.ui.commons.FileUploader({
	name: "upload3a",
	uploadOnChange: false,
	uploadUrl: "upload",
	width: "500px"});
layout.createRow(oFileUploader3a);
var oFileUploader3b = new sap.ui.commons.FileUploader({
	name: "upload3b",
	uploadOnChange: false,
	uploadUrl: "upload",
	width: "150px"});
layout.createRow(oFileUploader3b);

layout.placeAt("sample3");
